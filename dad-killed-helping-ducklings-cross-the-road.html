"As the man was in the intersection, a teenage driver was headed eastbound on Stanford Ranch Boulevard. This juvenile driver struck the pedestrian who was in the roadway."</p><p>"The driver remained at the scene of the collision," the local police department added. "Emergency first responders arrived to assist, however the man died at the scene."</p><p>The driver was a 17-year-old female. No arrest was made at the time and the driver is unlikely to face any charges. The incident is still under investigation.</p><p>"We still have a lot of areas and evidence to sort through, but at first look it does not look like there's going to be any criminal negligence," police told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>.</p><p>The victim was identified by the Placer County Sheriff's Office as 41-year-old Casey Rivara.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/4by3/2023/05/23/30359df6ad2d4ace9698dd55105c9b8f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">GoFundMe</span><p>The incident unfolded in front of neighbors, who were applauding the father's chivalrous efforts -- and even taking photos (above) -- just before tragedy struck.</p><p>A 12-year-old witness told local <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KCRA</a>, "He got out of the car and was shooing the ducks and everyone was clapping because he was being really nice."</p><p>"He helped them get up over the curb because all the little baby duckies were having trouble," the witness added.</p><p>"My mom rolled down the window and said, 'Good job, good job,' and I said, 'Good job' to him too and then right after that, the second after that," the child said that's when the car hit him.</p><p>"I didn't see the car actually hit him. All I remember is the sound and then him flying across the intersection," the 12-year-old said.

"Casey got out of the car to help the ducks safely across the road. However, when he was heading back to the car, he was tragically struck by a car and passed away at the scene."</p><p>"Casey met Angel, the love of his life, at age 17, when she joined his high school as an exchange student from Hong Kong," the fundraiser noted. "They quickly fell madly in love and remained inseparable partners for the past 23 years. They have been blessed with two beautiful children, Sophia (11) and James (6). His family was Casey’s world, and to remain even closer to them he had recently started working at their children's school. He loved working at the school as he was able to positively impact other children."</p><p>The drive has so far raised over $76k of a $30k goal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25ma2tfma6lecqio6WdlGK1prjPoqWgZZSqsKy4yKeerGWTp7y0v4ytn55loqSupXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./royal-caribbean-not-responsible-overboard-death-man-22-served-30-drinks-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Royal Caribbean found not responsible for overboard death of man, 22, who was served '30 drinks'</a>
