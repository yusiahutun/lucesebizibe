An October AARP poll showed Leavitt and Democratic incumbent Chris Pappas locked in a statistical tie, with Pappas at 48 and Leavitt at 47.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you had told me four or five years ago that I would be running for Congress in my mid-twenties, I would have laughed. I certainly would expect this to be my journey, Leavitt said in an interview with DailyMail.com. She added that this year was 'perfect timing' for an age-defying upset as she watched Democratic rule fall out of favor in her purple home district.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other GOP heavyweights might have been shocked too to see the ex-Trump White House and House GOP staffer's rise to the front - House leadership split on endorsing her in a primary. Former boss Stefanik endorsed Leavitt's race from the start while House GOP Leader <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-09fb9a90-59ff-11ed-8a52-a17025e89b6b>Kevin McCarthy</a> and GOP Whip Steve Scalise broke for Matt Mowers, another Trump staffer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm very thankful to the few folks in Washington who embraced me from the beginning,' she said in an interview with DailyMail.com, citing the support of former bosses Rep. Elise Stefanik and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Leavitt raised nearly $1 million in the two weeks following her upstart primary win. Now, the race between her and Pappas has become one of the most expensive of this election cycle, garnering more than $12 million from outside groups across the nation. It's a key seat that will help determine who controls the House, but for Leavitt winning means ushering in a whole new era of Gen Z conservatism.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-c0bf22e155aa357d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/01/15/64034983-11374157-Karoline_Leavitt_GOP_candidate_for_NH_01-a-22_1667317055751.jpg height=690 width=634 alt="Karoline Leavitt, GOP candidate for NH-01, would be the youngest congresswoman of all time if elected" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Karoline Leavitt, GOP candidate for NH-01, would be the youngest congresswoman of all time if elected&nbsp;</p><img id=i-81ced270f9417a32 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/01/15/64034961-11374157-image-a-3_1667314898494.jpg height=476 width=634 alt="Leavitt, 25, interned in the Trump White House before taking a job in the press shop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Leavitt, 25, interned in the Trump White House before taking a job in the press shop&nbsp;</p><img id=i-b2b793abdcee19b3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/01/15/64034973-11374157-image-a-5_1667314903302.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Leavitt is pictured above with former boss and early endorser Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her seat in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Asked what a Republican Congress should turn to first, Leavitt spouted off a rapid-fire list of classic conservative priorities, beginning with slashing spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We need to slash the spending, the unmitigated spending that's coming out of DC for useless pet projects that are burdensome to taxpayers,' Leavitt said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added: 'The media wants to talk about the environment, but for us, it's the cost of living. The American Dream has never been more unaffordable for young Americans.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Leavitt, who grew up scooping ice cream at her family's ice cream stand in Atkinson, New Hampshire, said she was running for Congress for families like her own who owned businesses and felt 'ripped off by the current leadership in Washington.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-2dd3f783eb9a645f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/11/01/15/64034957-11374157-image-a-8_1667315013037.jpg height=793 width=634 alt="Leavitt would be the second 25-year-old GOP member of Congress after Rep.
