At first, the two had a typical friendship bond, and after a few months, they began dating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2014, the two started dating, and after a while, they finally engaged. Likewise, their relationship was officially declared in August 2014 when Toriah’s step-father John shared their pictures on Facebook.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/92167133_2880549361993082_6828584455313394653_n-1.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the 28th of September 2014, her step-dad again made public some of his daughter and her boyfriend’s pictures, saying they were a new couple on Facebook on the occasion of senior homecoming day.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sadly, the former pair decided to split up or parted ways after three years of relationship in 2017.
