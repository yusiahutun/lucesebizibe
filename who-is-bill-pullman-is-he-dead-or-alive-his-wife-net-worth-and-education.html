His remarkable films include Ruthless People, Spaceballs, and While You Were Sleeping. In recent years, Pullman is best known for his role as Detective Harry Ambrose in the USA Network television series The Sinner. For his recurring role as Oswald Danes in Torchwood: Miracle Day, Pullman received a nomination for the Saturn Award as the best supporting actor on television.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Bill Pullman?</strong></h2><p>The American actor was born William James Pullman on December 17, 1953, in Hornell, New York. He is one of the 7 children of James Pullman and Johanna (née Blaas). Both his parents work in the medical field, his father is a doctor, and his mother a nurse. Pullman wanted to become a civil engineer, but in college, he fell in love with the theater. He taught theater for a while before he tried his hand at the stage at the suggestion of his students.</p><p>Pullman appeared in a number of stage productions in New York before he made his screen debut in 1986 in the film Ruthless People. While acting in films and television shows, Pullman remained true to his theater roots. He received reviews for his role in Edward Albee’s Broadway play “The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?”, which was performed for a year, from 2001 to 2002.</p><p>Bill Pulman is also a creative writer and has written as many plays from his pen as he has performed in theaters. He owns a production company called Big Town. Pullman has had a dulled sense of smell since the age of 21 when he fell off a ladder in college and fell into a deep coma. The actor stands 1 inch tall at a height of 6 feet.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is Taylor Schilling Gay, Married or Dating Anyone, Who is The Girlfriend or Wife</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>Bill Pullman’s education began in his hometown of Hornell New York, where he attended Hornell High School and graduated in 1971.

They have organized square dances, the proceeds of which are once again going into supporting the community. They run the Hollywood Orchard Foundation, a community initiative whose goal is to donate surplus fruit from people’s trees to those in need. The Foundation’s progress was portrayed in their documentary film “The Fruit Hunters”.</p><p>Pullman and his wife are blessed with three children, including sons Lewis Pullman and Jack Pullman and a daughter, Maesa Pullman. The couple passed on a generous portion of their artistic genes to their children. Maesa is a singer and songwriter, while Lewis, the older child born on January 29, 1993, is an actor.

His notable films include Battle of the Sexes and The Strangers: Loot at Night and Bad Times at El Royale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bill Pullman Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Bill Pullman may not be a blockbuster, but over the years he has appeared in a litany of films that have contributed to his wealth.
