Although this has been a boon for everybody curious and looking to expand their knowledge, it can sometimes become overwhelming for a person to sift through hundreds and thousands of articles on a particular topic. As far as mental health is concerned, the often detached and almost sterile tone of texts can prove to be a difficulty for the reader in relating to the content. This is why, film can be a way better medium to explore the nuances of sensitive topics of mental health and illnesses. Because of the earth of time in our fast-paced lives, we may not always be able to sit through an entire feature-length film. That’s where short films come in. We have compiled a list of 12 great short films that deal with mental health and disorders, directly or indirectly.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>8 Compelling Movies and TV Series That Explore Mental Health Themes</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>1.

Eli</h5><p><strong>Creator: </strong>Nate Milton</p><p>Eli is an 11-minute semi-autobiographical story, which was originally a form of self-therapy for the creator Nate Milton, who was diagnosed with <a href=#>bipolar disorder</a>. It was an attempt at focusing the ‘dark energy’ generated because of his mental health conditions into creative works. It is an animated short. The genre is science-fiction – the film deals with themes of mental health, stemming from the creators’ experiences in being in The realm of High Strangeness, Magical Thinking, and Manic Delusion.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>8.

Beat</h5><p><strong>Creator:</strong> Aneil Karia</p><p>Starring Ben Whishaw, Beat is a film about a man that society deems ‘unusual’ or ‘abnormal’, someone you would usually avoid. He acts impulsively and walks the thin line between consuming hopelessness and euphoria. Although this film does not talk about mental health issues overtly, it reveals to viewers the inner workings of a person who is deemed to be outside the norms society finds acceptable. It is a highly impactful film that will leave you reflecting on your social interactions and how society treats those who are ‘different’.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>The Psychology Behind Manifestation</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>10.

The Distraction</h5><p><strong>Creator:</strong> Matty Brown</p><p>This film is a 10-minute short depicting the extremely disorienting experience of an anxiety attack. The genius of this short film lies in its form of portrayal of mental health problems. Instead of showing the conditions of severe depression and anxiety from a third-person perspective, it attempts to emulate the feeling of everything being ‘too much’. The images and sounds in the film gradually become unhinged, providing the viewers with a close first-hand experience of those conditions.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>The Psychology Behind the Fear of Abandonment</a></strong></p><p>Short films that explore the subjects of mental health, depression, anxiety, grief, loss, abandonment, mental illnesses and disorders, and other such issues can be a great medium for creators and writers to put their experiences out into the world. They allow viewers to feel like they are not alone in their journey, and can also instil in them hope for the future and strength to keep battling against their problems. They can also be greatly helpful in eliminating the stigma around mental health issues, and sensitise the audiences towards those who are struggling.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Entertain</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Why do people love K-dramas?</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Entertain</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Benefits of Playing Dumb</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Entertain</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Samantha: “My Fan base is more Interested in</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Entertain</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>BIRD BOX- A War with One’s Own Fears</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 27, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Entertain</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>From Confessions to Chaos: Exploring the Psychology Behind</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 26, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmampdqLWwvtNmnaKknah6tbTArWStmZygeqKuzq6rZqWVo8GiuIyhnJqkpJ18</p></div><div id=links><a href=./439551-20-short-prayers-family-difficult-times.html>&#171;&nbsp;20 short prayers for your family during the difficult times</a>
