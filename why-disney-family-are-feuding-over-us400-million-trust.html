However, the trustees dispersed the payments to Michelle, but withheld Brad's. Michelle and the trustees argued that Brad wasn't capable of managing his share because of a “chronic cognitive disability” and that Bill, their father, was taking advantage of this to gain money, according to NBC News.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bill argued that the trustees were manipulating his daughter, Michelle.

He reportedly agreed to an annual settlement of US$500,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Michelle reportedly suffered from drug addiction and had a brain aneurysm that “left her with uncertain mental abilities”, the trustees agreed with her about her brother, Gardner wrote.

In 2003, Roy E. announced plans to sell 7.5 million Disney shares – about 43 per cent of his stake in the company, reported Randall Smith and Bruce Orwall of The Wall Street Journal.

And that's why I feel hyperconscious about what wealth does to people.

It also does not, in and of itself, makes you a good person. You are who you are and the least important thing about you is what you have.” Abigail is a documentary filmmaker and founded Fork Films, which focuses on international social issues. She added that the fortune she inherited would have made her a billionaire if she wanted to be one, and that she would outlaw private jets if she could.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was one of 18 ultra-wealthy Americans to sign a letter asking presidential candidates to support a wealth tax in June 2019. In a 25-tweet thread, Abigail slammed Disney's decision to furlough its 43,000 employees without first cancelling plans to pay shareholder bonuses and executive bonuses, reported Business Insider's Taylor Nicole Rogers. Top executives have taken pay cuts to conserve the company's cash during the crisis, but their potential to still earn bonuses is “the REAL outrage”, Disney tweeted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Abigail's brother, Roy P., said in an interview that by 1960, Walt and Roy O. owned about 20 per cent of the company.

In 1984, Roy E. replaced him with Eisner, according to People. The move reportedly deepened the family divide, but the two families later patched things up. Roy E. was the only heir to get involved in the family business, which Walt tried to steer his children and grandchildren away from, according to Gardner. While Diane didn't get involved in corporate matters, she reportedly worked the hardest to preserve Walt's legacy, creating the Walt Disney Family Museum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Most of the Disney family has shied away from corporate affairs, instead displaying their wealth and power philanthropically, according to Gardner</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/02/c5ad1300-8922-11ea-8a72-3b4a65ec119d_972x_151434.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Disney family members – and the company itself – have donated millions to charity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lillian donated US$274 million for a new concert hall in Los Angeles, according to The New York Times.

Her family has reportedly contributed nearly US$100 million toward building Disney Hall on Bunker Hill.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Gardner, the Lund family is committed to the Sharon Disney Lund Foundation, donating money to cancer research and visiting the scientists. The Foundation has also donated US$1 million to a non-profit arts organisation for teens. So far, Abigail has donated about US$70 million and plans to keep “giving a lot of money away” until her death, she told The Cut.
