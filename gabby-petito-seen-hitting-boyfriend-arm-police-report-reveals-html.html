as he approached the vehicle and asked to speak to her outside.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The report was redacted to conceal sensitive information but suggests Gabby told police she and

wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Because of her [redacted] and [redacted], combined with little arguments she and Brian had been having that day, she was struggling with her mental health, which led to the incident that was reported to law enforcement.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added that at 'no point' in his investigation did Gabby 'stop crying, breathing heavily, or
