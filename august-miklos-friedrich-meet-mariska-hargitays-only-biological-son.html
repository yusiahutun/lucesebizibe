Despite the complications surrounding his birth, this celebrity kid is so loved.</strong></p><p>August Miklos Friedrich’s mother, Mariska Hargitay, faced numerous challenges during her pregnancy, making it difficult for her. At the age of 42, she eagerly awaited the arrival of her child, expressing her strong desire to become a mother. From the moment she discovered her pregnancy, she embraced the experience wholeheartedly, even wearing maternity clothes despite having a flat stomach. Her excitement was evident.</p><p>However, her pregnancy took a toll on her health. During the third trimester, she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which required her to change her diet significantly. As a first-time mother, she initially felt pressured to consume more food from every food group to ensure her baby’s well-being.</p><p>This led her to overeat, exacerbating her struggle with gestational diabetes. These dietary adjustments added another layer of difficulty to her already challenging pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-7_21_30_38.jpg><p>Mariska Hargitay found moving and remaining mobile increasingly challenging as her pregnancy progressed. Her growing belly and the limitations imposed by her health condition made it physically demanding for her. The joy and anticipation she felt were overshadowed by the physical discomfort she experienced. Nevertheless, despite her obstacles, she remained resilient and determined to bring her child into the world.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=August_Miklos_Friedrichs_Mum_Faced_Some_Difficulties_After_His_Birth></span>August Miklos Friedrich’s Mum Faced Some Difficulties After His Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The difficulties didn’t end with August’s birth. Balancing her demanding filming schedule and her role as a mother proved to be a constant challenge for Mariska Hargitay. She admitted to feeling a sense of jealousy toward other parents who had the opportunity to take their children to school and pick them up.</p><p>Attending her son’s school events, she found herself among a close-knit community of parents who already knew one another. Being an outsider in this community further added to the complexity of her role as a working mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_August_Miklos_Friedrich></span>Meet August Miklos Friedrich<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hargitay gave birth to August Miklos Friedrich Hermann on June 28, 2006. This was less than two years after she married Peter Hermann. August is the couple’s only biological child, and he has a striking resemblance with his mum, including the same hair color and eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-7_21_32_39.jpg><p>There is no information regarding August’s education or personal life. However, we believe the handsome teenager is in high school currently. We also know he loves basketball, as he is often spotted with his parents at the NBA games.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Augusts_Parents></span>Meet August’s Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>August’s mother is Mariska Hargitay. She is a well-known American actress. Hargitay gained widespread recognition for portraying Detective Olivia Benson on NBC’s long-running series “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” This role earned her prestigious accolades like an Emmy and a Golden Globe. She has also appeared in other television shows, including “Downtown,” “Tequila,” “Bonetti,” “Can’t Hurry Love,” and “ER.”</p><p>In addition to her acting achievements, Hargitay founded the Joyful Heart Foundation in 2004. This foundation is dedicated to supporting survivors of domestic violence and child abuse. Hargitay’s commitment to this cause reflects her compassion and desire to make a positive impact beyond her acting career.</p><p>On the other hand, Peter Hermann, August’s dad, is a German-American actor who gained recognition for his recurring role as defense attorney Trevor Langan on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=August_Miklos_Friedrichs_Parents_Fell_in_Love_on_a_Movie_Set></span>August Miklos Friedrich’s Parents Fell in Love on a Movie Set<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Peter and Hargitay first crossed paths on the set of the “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” The couple’s enduring relationship began during season 3 when Peter was cast for a guest appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-7_21_34_0.jpg><p>Their romance blossomed shortly after the filming ended when Peter invited Hargitay to attend church. She was deeply moved by the experience and realized that Peter was the person she wanted to spend her life with.</p><p>The couple started dating, and after about two years, their intuition proved correct as they exchanged vows in Santa Barbara, California, in 2004. Hargitay has been married to Peter Hermann for close to two decades.</p><p>Looking back on their relationship, Hargitay expressed her certainty about Peter being the right partner for her. Their enduring marriage has been regarded as one of the most successful in Hollywood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=August_Has_Two_Adopted_Siblings></span>August Has Two Adopted Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In April 2011, <a href=#>Mariska Hargitay</a> and Peter Hermann expanded their family by adopting a baby girl named Amaya Josephine. Four months later, in October 2011, they welcomed their adopted son Andrew Nicolas.&nbsp;</p><p>August embraced his role as a big brother to Amaya and Andrew, expressing his desire for siblings. Hargitay revealed in an interview in 2012 that August believed it was his idea to have a baby sister because Amaya came into their lives shortly after expressing this wish.</p><p>He refers to Amaya as “his baby” and expresses his determination to protect her. What can we say? he is his mother’s son — a woman who protects and inspires others to do the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture.png><p>Similarly, Andrew joined the family when August expressed his desire for a baby brother. Without hesitation, they welcomed Andrew into their family, and the bond between the three siblings formed seamlessly.</p><p>While Hargitay and Peter maintain a personal approach regarding their children, they have emphasized on multiple occasions that they give complete attention and devotion to them. Their limited time with their children has made Hargitay contemplate leaving her role in the “Law & Order” series, as she prioritizes being present for her family.</p><p>One thing that is clear about August is that he loves his family, and his family loves him. Speaking of adoption, <a href=#>Ty Burrell</a> and his wife have no biological children. However, they are parents to two beautiful girls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krraz1KyrZqWZoLmwv4yfqaKdlKe2pLSMppyerF2irrO10qSYZqCRp7SqwMCyqmannqHGbq7IqKOon5mYrq150qilaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./get-your-tea-tati-westbrook-james-charles-drama.html>&#171;&nbsp;Get Your Tea: Tati Westbrook &amp;amp; James Charles' Drama</a>
