This tradition that we call sauna has persisted through the millennia for good reason: Exceptional and very real health benefits, like relieving muscle tension, improving sleep quality, and boosting mood.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But, unless you happen to be a hardcore Finnish carpenter, chances are you’re not constructing a purpose-built room in your home or apartment that can heat up to 190 degrees in your home or apartment. Enter the infrared sauna blanket, with all the sweaty benefits of traditional sauna, but in an apartment-friendly, sleeping bag-style design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re not fans of wasting money and these wellness tools aren’t cheap, so our team of InStyle editors laid and sweated in their sauna blankets four times a week for five weeks to determine which ones were worth the splurge. We investigated every angle of the sauna blanket experience, including a painless set up, as well as the degree of comfort we felt while lounging in our blankets, the amount of extra wiggle room our legs enjoyed, and the technical details, like the range of heat settings and convenient features. We huddled with our data and ranked each sauna blanket to provide you with this definitive list of the best at-home sauna blankets that are worth their weight in sweat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-lifepro-rejuvawrap-infrared-sauna-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LifePro RejuvaWrap Infrared Sauna Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LifePro RejuvaWrap Infrared Sauna Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AO7CpgugGYP6304aAi3L3RWFkw0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2023-08-08T085812.250-e4e3491958be49abb8ddd5c6960228da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>LifePro</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>&nbsp;This blanket provides an undeniably rejuvenating feel and features a non-toxic, waterproof fabric.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The highest heat setting might not be sufficient for those who are frequent sauna goers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We selected LifePro RejuvaWrap Infrared Sauna Blanket as our best overall choice, which we used once a week for three months. Although almost $400, this investment-worthy sauna blanket made us feel refreshed and energetic, simply after one use. The blanket—crafted from non-toxic, waterproof faux leather with layers of flexible cotton underneath—also came with handy accessories like a head towel, a carrying bag, and a pack of five disposable detox wraps to lay in for an ultra sweaty session.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved that the setup process was so effortless, with absolutely no hassle involved. First, we unfolded the blanket, spread it out on the floor, and plugged in the product cord. Then, we set the timer for 60 minutes on level eight. The panel allows you to select heat levels from one through eight and you can bake for up to an hour. And voila, just like that, we transported ourselves into a spa-like sauna.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re new to the sauna game, we suggest starting off on the lower end of the heat spectrum. On the other hand, if you’re a frequent sauna-goer we think you’ll be comfortable using a higher level heat setting. In fact, you might even wish the temperature went even higher—we did notice that for those of us accustomed to regular exposure to sauna heat, we could’ve used another level or two. Also we would have preferred a pillow instead of the head towel that came with this sauna blanket.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $399</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane leather, waterproof oxford fabric |<strong> Temperature Range: </strong>77–176 degrees | <strong>Heating Zones</strong>: 1 | <strong>Automatic Shut Off</strong>: Yes | <strong>Settings</strong>: 8 settings with timer up to 1 hour | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 71 in x 31 in unfolded | <strong>Weight</strong>: 18.21 pounds | <strong>Storage Case</strong>: Yes | <strong>Closure</strong>: Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lifepro-bioremedy-infrared-sauna-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LifePro Sauna Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LifePro BioRemedy Infrared Sauna Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cVs67xv7NYC5ui7Up9iNesrhIwg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lifepro-bioremedy-infrared-sauna-blanket-965e3bc58698415a882d636c4aa38300.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>For an affordable price, this blanket supplies ample heat, and it even features zippered slits on the side for your arms to move around freely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The material feels a bit too plasticky, we wish it was more soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want the spa-like treatment without those spa membership prices, consider the LifePro BioRemedy Infrared Sauna Blanket, which we tested twice a week on average for an entire month. This soothing blanket increases your body temperature, helping you to accelerate your sweat level and release toxins.&nbsp;And we can confidently say that our sweat levels were through the roof. We even got a little too warm while sweating everything out, but we were easily able to give ourselves some air by unzipping the splits on the side of the blanket to rest our arms outside of the blanket. In fact, this was our favorite feature for moments we got too hot, but didn't want to jump all the way out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And thanks to the long cord attached, we were able to use this blanket, which is about the size of a big sleeping bag, basically everywhere—from the floor to the sofa, and even in our beds. To boot, this affordable option was also far from cumbersome, and we could easily roll it up and store it in our closet, or keep it unfolded and slide it under our beds, which was key consideration, given the size of our NYC apartment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for features that we could have gone without, the interior of the blanket was a bit too plasticky. Also, this blanket did get very warm, and it might take some time to fully acclimate if you're sensitive to heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $199</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane leather, waterproof oxford fabric |<strong> Temperature Range: </strong>113–176 degrees | <strong>Heating Zones</strong>: 1 | <strong>Automatic Shut Off</strong>: Yes | <strong>Settings</strong>:&nbsp;3 settings with timer up to 1 hour | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 71 in x 36 in unfolded | <strong>Weight</strong>: 10.3 pounds | <strong>Storage Case</strong>: Yes | <strong>Closure</strong>: Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-temperature-range-mihigh-infrared-sauna-blanket-by-gravity></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Temperature Range</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MiHIGH Infrared Sauna Blanket by Gravity</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MiHIGH Infrared Sauna Blanket by Gravity" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oIM_o5nFQm_n_sFDHf3oIPUQPy8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mihigh-infrared-sauna-blanket-by-gravity-f8f79776da6743f78247143c92d00f83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gravity Blankets</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are nine heat levels with temperatures from 95 degrees to 167 degrees, making this blanket great for sauna aficionados and beginners alike.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>&nbsp;The weight of the blanket is a bit much, which might feel comforting to some but not others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re the type to go from warm to hot in a flash like us, you’ll love the wide range of temperature settings on this sauna blanket so you can go back and forth quickly and easily if you get too warm. This sauna blanket offers an array of different levels from one to nine, ranging from 95 degrees to 167 degrees.&nbsp; This wide range of temperature options also makes this blanket an excellent choice for beginners who want to start at a hot (but not a Sahara- hot) level, and work their way up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During each sweat session, we appreciated how we could just slide into the blanket, close our eyes, and not worry about a thing, thanks to the automatic shut off once the blanket hit our desired time setting. And when we got a little too toasty, we didn’t have to unzip the blanket and disrupt our experience, but instead we could just keep the remote handy and quickly dial it down. We fully condone slipping into this sauna blanket and catching up on a quick nap.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we rolled out the blanket for the first time, it didn’t look bulky, but once we got inside, we were surprised at how roomy it was, allowing us to fully stretch out without hitting the sides. Perhaps it even had too much room. Because of its size, it did feel a bit like a weighted blanket—which might feel soothing for some, and uncomfortable for others.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $499</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane leather exterior, waterproof fabric interior&nbsp; |<strong> Temperature Range: </strong>95–167 degrees | <strong>Heating Zones</strong>: 1 | <strong>Automatic Shut Off</strong>: Yes | <strong>Settings</strong>: 9 settings with timer up to 1 hour | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>62 in unfolded | <strong>Weight</strong>: 20.1 pounds | <strong>Storage Case</strong>: Yes | <strong>Closure</strong>: Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-zero-emf-heat-healer-infrared-sauna-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Zero EMF</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Heat Healer Infrared Sauna Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Heat Healer Infrared Sauna Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rGiyE194bybln_f-XUEN0qXFEYw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Heat-Healer-Infrared-Sauna-Blanket-1460788b03e4426f88c3b1fd0043a8a7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Heat Healer</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The design of the blanket provides the safest sauna blanket experience on this list.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>&nbsp;It’s very large, so this blanket is not ideal for those who are limited in space.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">EMF stands for electromagnetic fields, which, in non-marketing speak, is more commonly called radiation. This sounds worse than it is, as most EMF is not harmful; in fact, the light bulbs we use daily emit more EMF than an infrared sauna blanket. Designed with zero-EMF infrared coils, which are specifically designed to cut emissions to zero, this tech-forward blanket promises a totally safe experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even better, it’s also designed with 96 jade and tourmaline stones to aid the body’s absorption process, as it disperses heat throughout the coils. When we unpacked and fully unrolled the blanket, we noticed the jade and tourmaline stones on the bottom side, and we made sure to place the cotton blanket inside over the stones to create a comfortable barrier. The stones felt incredible beneath our backs, almost as if we were receiving a mini-massage.&nbsp; We also loved the feeling of the pillow beneath our heads, as it allowed us to feel even more relaxed. We set the time for 50 minutes, and decided to unwind and flip through a book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although we enjoyed how we felt once inside the blanket, we weren’t huge fans of the set up process. One, the instructions didn’t mention what we should wear while inside the blanket, and we felt that this could've been a bit more explicit. And two, it was sort of annoying to unroll the blanket because of how large it was. We even struggled to fit it on our couch and had to remove some of the cushions to make it fit, but it was smooth sailing from there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $508&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Premium heat resistant Aramid fabric |<strong> Temperature Range: </strong>140–176 degrees | <strong>Heating Zones</strong>: 1 | <strong>Automatic Shut Off</strong>:&nbsp;Yes | <strong>Settings</strong>: 9 settings with timer up to 1 hour | <strong>Dimensions: </strong>75 in x 69 in unfolded | <strong>Weight</strong>: 24 pounds | <strong>Storage Case</strong>: Yes | <strong>Closure</strong>: Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-muscle-recovery-higherdose-infrared-sauna-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Muscle Recovery</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HigherDose Sauna Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HigherDose Infrared Sauna Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i8AFH9GZdKwAMPalonAB4AKuzf8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/higherdose-infrared-sauna-blanket-ded9dd1166ae4f169d98be3b7bab694f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>&nbsp;The warmth of the blanket helped soothe our muscle aches.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>&nbsp;It doesn't come with a carrying case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dealing with achy muscles can be a chore on its own, so why not make things a bit easier for yourself by simply slipping into the HigherDose Sauna Blanket? This relaxing blanket uses infrared technology to elevate the body’s thermal energy, which in turn, increases blood flow through the body to get rid of lactic acid stored in your muscles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To soothe our muscles, we decided to put this blanket to the test, using it everywhere from the bed to the couch. The instructions were very clear, and it didn’t take us long to begin our sweating process. And after just one hour of sweating, we noticed that our muscles felt much looser. There was also an overall feeling of flexibility, almost as if we had just completed a thorough stretching session. To wrap things up, we simply sprayed the blanket with a disinfectant spray and wiped it down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we did notice that the HigherDose Sauna Blanket didn’t offer an option to select independent heating zones.

Then we spent the next four weeks laying and sweating in our sauna blankets at home. As we laid in our respective blankets, we evaluated each one based on a specific set of criteria, including ease of set up, ease of use, design, and value. We also observed specific features such as temperature range, time settings, dimensions, and more.

"Infrared sauna blankets can be much more tolerable for those who are sensitive to heat,” says NYC-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Macrene Alexiades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not to say you shouldn’t crank it up. Personal trainer and corrective exercise specialist, Samantha Altan reminds us that a traditional sauna reaches temperatures of 150-195 degrees. The lower temperatures offered by infrared sauna is one of the primary appeals. That means, according to Altan, you should be looking for a minimum temperature of 68 degrees and a maximum of around 158 degrees.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A full-size infrared sauna generally is heated to between 110 and 135 degrees,” Altan says. “So you’ll definitely want your blanket to achieve those temperatures as well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re sensitive to heat, it’s particularly important to consider the highest heat setting as well as the time it takes for the blanket to reach it. “Start with lower temperatures and shorter sessions, gradually increasing them as your tolerance builds,” suggests Dr. Tony Nakhla, a board-certified dermatologist with a practice in Orange County, California, He adds that dehydration can become a concern if you stay in the blanket too long, so keep a water bottle handy to prevent fluid loss.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Settings</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All infrared sauna blankets are equipped with temperature settings, and some offer more specificity and customization than others. If you want to know exactly what temperature your blanket is heating to, look for models with more settings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll also likely want a model with a built-in timer, as recommended by board certified naturopath, Dr. Lana Butner. She and all our experts caution against the risk of dehydration when utilizing a sauna. Ensuring that your infrared sauna blanket sessions are long enough to allow you to reap the full benefits, but not overdoing it and risking dehydration is crucial.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some models offer multiple heating zones, allowing you to more precisely control the temperature in different areas of the blanket. If, for example, you know you’d like your feet to stay cooler than your torso, this might be an appealing feature for you. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every body is different, says Dovey, so it’s important to make sure your individual body dimensions and preferences can be accommodated by the model you are purchasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Some people can tend to feel a bit claustrophobic if the blanket is too tight or heavy,” warns Ominsky.

Although if a bout of claustrophobia hits, it’s much faster to jump out of a velcro closure than a zipper. Velcro closures also allow the blanket to open completely flat, which can make cleaning and storing a bit easier. &nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do infrared sauna blankets work?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the scientific sounding name, the concept behind infrared sauna blankets is pretty simple, according to Dr. Alexiades. “Infrared saunas are just a newer spin on the traditional sauna experience,” she explains. “They focus on the infrared delivery of heat rather than other forms of heat production. Infrared rays heat up the body with less impact on the temperature of the room, but still induce the intense sweating that characterizes a sauna experience.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An infrared sauna blanket delivers heat to your body through the air, similar to what you would experience in a cabin, just in a much smaller space. According to Dovey, this is what makes infrared sauna blankets so great: “A sauna blanket actually heats up quicker and is more energy efficient and space saving than a traditional cabin.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the benefits of an infrared sauna blanket?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The benefits of infrared saunas mirror and even improve upon those of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>traditional home saunas</a>, according to all of our experts. Dr. Alexiades calls out that sauna has been shown to improve cardiovascular function and lower blood pressure, while Ominsky says that many of her clients seek out sauna because it can reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism and release toxins from the body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Butner is particularly keen to highlight the detoxifying benefits. She says that internal organs, including the kidney, bowels, lymph nodes and lungs, reap major benefits from infrared therapy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Alexiades agrees: "On the skin level, sauna use has been reported to not only flush out toxins, but also to remove dead skin cells, purge clogged pores, deliver fresh nutrient supplies to the epidermis, and help reduce the prevalence of stress-related skin breakouts.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Altan is a particular fan of sauna for the pain relief and muscle relaxation it can offer after a tough workout. “The heat of a sauna helps promote muscle relaxation by reducing muscle tension and eliminating lactic acid and other toxins that may be present,” she says. “Under the high-heat provided by a sauna, the body releases endorphins which can also help to minimize pain. As the body temperature rises in the heat of the sauna, blood vessels dilate allowing for increased blood circulation, which in turn speeds the body’s natural healing process.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond the health benefits, the most obvious benefit of an infrared sauna blanket is that it allows you to sweat it out in your own home. And some, like Ominsky, even would argue that the blanket experience is, in some ways, an enhancement on the relaxation of traditional sauna rooms. “One of the best attributes of the blankets,” Ominsky says, “is that when you are lying down it allows the blood to circulate and that contributes to a deeper relaxation while receiving all the benefits.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to unwind and relax, Dr. Nakhla says that the heat from the blanket can reduce stress while detoxifying the body. “Advocates claim that infrared heat can help the body detoxify by promoting sweating, which may help eliminate toxins and heavy metals from the body,” he says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the downsides of using an infrared sauna blanket?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Nakhla explains that although infrared sauna blankets are certainly beneficial, experts are still unsure with regard to whether or not they are as effective as actual saunas. “The effectiveness of infrared sauna blankets compared to traditional saunas is a matter of debate, with some experts questioning their ability to provide the same benefits.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are infrared sauna blankets safe?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If infrared sauna blankets aren't used properly, there could be a few health-related consequences. Exposure to high heat over long periods of time can lead to burning, overheating, and dehydration according to Dr. Nakhla. It can also lead to irritation if you have sensitive skin or skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis. Also, high temperatures can affect heart rate and blood pressure. “If you have heart problems, high blood pressure, or other cardiovascular conditions, consult with a healthcare professional before using an infrared sauna blanket,” says Dr. Nakhla.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I wouldn't recommend using infrared sauna blankets for children or pregnant women either,” Mitro adds.

But at the end of the day, everyone is different. So in addition to playing by the rules , you should also pay close attention to your body. “Individual tolerance and goals may vary, so listen to your body and consult a healthcare professional if needed,” says &nbsp;Mitro.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you’re a first-time infrared sauna blanket user, it’s important to work your way up to this point. “It's recommended to start with 10 to 15 minutes of use and slowly build up the time you are using it, just like you would if you were in a sauna,” says Mitro.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pregnant women should avoid both sauna blankets as well as traditional saunas for the duration of their pregnancy. Additionally, anyone with a medical condition should pay particular attention to their usage, says Dr. Butner.
