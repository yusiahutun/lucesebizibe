small-enough-for-a-stocking category, there's no need to limit yourself to boring stocking stuffers. Read on as we showcase some great items to tuck in all those stockings hung on the mantle with care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While what constitutes a stocking stuffer varies from household to household, we've opted to stick with two traditional traditional measures. All our stocking stuffers actually fit in a stocking and they're all relatively inexpensive ($25 or less).</p><p>This is the fifth of the How-To Geek 2013 Holiday Gift Guides; to keep up with the rest of the guides throughout December, be sure to keep an eye on the article tag&nbsp;GiftGuide2013.</p><h2 id=ruggedized-flash-drives-for-geeks-on-the-go>Ruggedized Flash Drives for Geeks on the Go</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbb398c73b.png><p>For the geek on the go, it's nice to keep portable apps and data right at hand (and, conveniently, on your key chain). Flash drives are perfect for that, but historically they were made of cheap plastic that often ended up cracked or, even worse, snapped right off the key chain attachment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately there are a wide variety of metal/ruggedized flash drives on the market now. I keep the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Kingston Data Traveler SE9</a> ($11 and up) on my keychain: it's so small and lightweight it's hard to believe &nbsp;32GB of storage takes up less space than my house key. Speaking of house keys, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">LaCie PetiteKey</a> ($19 and up) actually looks like a key thanks to an extremely slim form factor. There's also an aluminum and chrome model from <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Silicon Power</a> ($19) that offers slightly different styling but the same rugged durability.</p><p>Given that all these drives cost pretty much the same (give or take a dollar) as their cheap plastic counterparts, there's really no good reason to go for a plastic body/removable cap model over a waterproof all-in-one ruggedized model.</p><h2 id=battery-packs-to-power-gadgets-galore>Battery Packs to Power Gadgets Galore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbbe3b3605.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smartphones, tablets, and portable gaming systems like the DS and PSVita are all power hungry (and there's nothing worse than not having power when you need it). For those go-go-go movers on your list that need power away from their home or office, a battery pack is a great way to make their lives easier. The devices work on a simple principle: you charge them up at home like you would charge up your phone or tablet and then, when you're out and about, you can plug your device via its USB cable right into the battery to get extra juice.</p><p>For lightweight use, little lipstick-sized chargers like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Anker Astro Mini</a> ($20) are perfect for topping off a smartphone with a charge or two. A similar device is the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Intocircuit T5000</a> ($22), which offers additional battery life in a slightly bigger package.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Be forewarned, however, if you want a battery pack beefy enough to charge an iPad or other large device&nbsp;while you're actively using it, you'll need to spend a little bit more than our $25 stocking stuffer limit and pick up a larger battery pack with a 2A output (most smaller/inexpensive packs have 1A output which doesn't provide enough output to keep up with an in-use iPad). For such situations, something like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Anker Astro</a> ($30) is a better fit.</p><h2 id=robots>Robots!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbcc0ba786.png><p>We know, we know. Our list is overly serious so far with all this talk of flash drives and batteries, so: unleash the robots! Whether you're slipping them in the stocking of a five year old or a fifty year old, the antics of tiny robots delight just about everybody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the biggest producers and certainly the company that really kicked off the tiny-robot craze across the country last year is Innovation Labs, the maker of the Hexbug line of toys. They make bigger Hexbugs, about the size of a child's palm, like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Hexbug Scarab</a> ($10) and the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Hexbug Ant </a>($9) as well as the very popular and tiny Hexbug Nanos ($11 <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">for one</a>&nbsp;or $30 <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">for a set of 5</a>).</p><p>The larger robots each have their own trick (the Ants run around and change direction when they bump into things, other Hexbugs hide from light, respond to sound, etc.). The smaller Hexbug Nanos are essentially pager motors with little rubber legs: the vibration of the motor causes their little rubber legs to vibrate and propel them forward quickly and unpredictably. The Nanos were a huge hit at our house last year with grown ups, kids, and cats alike. If you're headed to a holiday party or have a bunch of stockings to stuff, we recommend getting a Nano pack. Watching a bunch of Nanos interact with each other is way more fun than watching a single one zip around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=headphones-for-ears-big-and-small>Headphones for Ears Big and Small</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbdb86300c.png><p>Headphones cords take a beating, headphones themselves get lost, and it's always nice to have an extra pair of earbuds tucked away somewhere. Given the prevalence of portable electronic gift giving, it's nice to have a fresh pair of headphones to go with your shiny new device.</p><p>While there's certainly a market for crazy $$$ audiophile earbuds, most people aren't going to be dropping $300 on a pair of&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Etymotic Research Noise Isolating Earbuds</a>&nbsp;to stuff a stocking (if you are, we'd like to come to your house for Christmas). Fortunately for the budget conscious, there are a ton of really highly-reviewed earbuds on the $ to $$ end of the scale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Panasonic's RPHJE120K earbuds</a>&nbsp;are a mere $5-8 depending on the color you select and are among the highest ranked earbuds on Amazon with 4.5 stars based on a whopping &nbsp;8,191 reviews. In a similar price range, you can pick up Sony's over-the-ear MDR-ZX100 headphones for a mere $17 (also highly rated with 4 stars based on 2,786 reviews).</p><p>One thing we'd strongly recommend if you're purchasing headphones for a child is to buy a&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">volume limiting attachment</a>&nbsp;or a set of headphones with volume limiting built right in. Kids often turn up their devices way too loud, volume-limiting circuitry keeps them from turning the volume up into the hearing-damaging range.<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">&nbsp;JLabs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sony</a>&nbsp;both have kid-friendly over-the-ear headphones ($14-20). In-ear headphones for kids are a bit trickier to find (most companies make over-ear as it's much easier to fit a wide range of kids and nobody wants to be the company that encourages children to shove things in their ears) but they're out there:<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">&nbsp;dB Logic's EP-100 model</a>&nbsp;retails for $15-20.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=magnets-because-science-is-magic>Magnets: Because Science is Magic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbecf1f4a1.jpg><p>Magnetism is one of those fun-to-play-with phenomena that appeals to all ages. There's no shortage of cool magnetic toys either. The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Mysterious Magnet Tube</a> ($15) is a sealed 5" tall cylinder filled with iron shavings and a magnet you can use to visualize magnetic waves. If you want to actually get your hands on the magnets, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Crazy Aaron's Super Magnetic Putty</a> ($15) is a weird but fun hybrid of silly putty and ferromagnetic particles.</p><p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">&nbsp;CMS Magnetics' &nbsp;building kits</a> ($9 and up) that combine power magnetic spheres with steel connector rods encased in plastic that combine to for all sorts of neat structures all held together by magnetism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of magnets, let's not neglect the magnet mecca in the home: the refrigerator. Have a LEGO fanatic? Give them a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">pack of magnetic LEGO bases</a> ($4 for 5) to showcase their favorite LEGO figures or lightweight creations on the fridge. Know they have a favorite LEGO series? You can buy the bases and the figures together like these <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Star Wars figures</a>&nbsp;($14) or these <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Harry Potter figure</a>s ($24). No need to stop yourself at LEGO magnets, you can find them for all manner of subjects like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Doctor Who</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Star Trek</a>, and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">more</a>.</p><h2 id=finally-indulge-their-fanhood>&nbsp;Finally, Indulge Their Fanhood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_52afbf46f0cf1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The last bit about LEGO characters, Doctor Who, and the like, brings us to the best thing about geeky stocking stuffers.
