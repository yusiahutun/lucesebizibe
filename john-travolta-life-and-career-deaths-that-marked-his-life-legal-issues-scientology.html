Beginning with a meteoric rise to fame in the '70s, he was hit with a string of box office flops in the '80s, before rising from the ashes with a critically acclaimed performance in <a class=hm-link href=#>Pulp Fiction</a> (1994).&nbsp;</p><p id=esQjTy7jPWL data-wc=50>And now, after decades on our screens, the Hollywood heavyweight has officially turned 70! To mark his milestone birthday, we're taking a look at John's life and career, from his early life in New Jersey to his legal issues, Scientology journey, and family tragedies, here's what you need to know…</p><h3 dir=ltr>Early life&nbsp;</h3><p id=egnOjnhzGQ4 data-wc=55>Born in New Jersey on February 18, 1954, John grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. The youngest of six children, John's father, Salvatore Travolta, was a second-generation Italian American, who became a semi-professional American football player and tire salesman. Meanwhile, his mother, Helen Cecilia, had been an actress and singer. She later became a teacher. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/cb36f4916379-john-travolta-with-his-parents.jpg><p id=eA51xF9VsWZ data-wc=34>A family of creatives, John wasn't the only one to inherit his mother's love of acting.

I remember we always challenged ourselves to be different characters in different scenarios as kids," John told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Youth Time</a> magazine in 2014. "As in Broadway, you act, you sing, you dance. In the film industry, sometimes you do a musical, sometimes you do a drama, sometimes you do a comedy. This transition was not difficult for me, as I'm used to it from childhood."&nbsp;</p><p id=ez7Vk7qQT4Y data-wc=20>Explaining that he grew up in a "working class family," John added that they never had "an overabundance of money."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More milestone birthdays</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Robbie Williams at 50: from Take That exit to substance abuse and happy marriage to Ayda" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d55a8051ea04-robbie-williams-at-60.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Robbie Williams at 50: from Take That exit to substance abuse and happy marriage to Ayda" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Robbie Williams at 50: from Take That exit to substance abuse and happy marriage to Ayda</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Brad Pitt at 60: his two divorces, FBI review, cognitive disorder, getting sober and new love" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2c1940de72f7-brad-pitt.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Brad Pitt at 60: his two divorces, FBI review, cognitive disorder, getting sober and new love" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Brad Pitt at 60: his two divorces, FBI review, cognitive disorder, getting sober and new love</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Nicolas Cage at 60: His five marriages, 2011 arrest, career comeback & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9c05f2b866cf-close-up-of-nicolas-cage-in-a-red-suit.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Nicolas Cage at 60: His five marriages, 2011 arrest, career comeback & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Nicolas Cage at 60: His five marriages, 2011 arrest, career comeback & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3 dir=ltr>Rise to Fame&nbsp;</h3><p id=e0xByV-MAiQ data-wc=62>With his parents' permission, 16-year-old John decided to drop out of high school and pursue an acting career in New York. "Not too many of my friends identified with what I was doing," the star recalled in 1978. "I participated in football and basketball, and did what they were doing, but not many kids understood my going to acting studios at night."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9f5c3d95f482-john-travolta-in-welcome-back-kotter.jpg><p id=eGDn1CQJ_hK data-wc=31>After moving to the Big Apple, John secured small roles on Broadway.

A turning point for the fledgling actor, John was eventually cast as Vinnie Barbarino in the 1975 sitcom, – a role which he'd embrace for the next four years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/4e9d7a62d783-john-travolta-filming-carrie.jpg><p id=eQn-P0dAfFT data-wc=75>With credits in theatre and TV, John went on to secure his breakout film role in the 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's . Delivering a memorable performance as prankster and bully, Billy Nolan, the actor was thrust onto the world stage. Following its release, the supernatural horror, directed by Brian De Palma, became a box office success, and it also received universal acclaim.

"And I said, 'Well of course.'"</p><p id=egBj7I4AMvC data-wc=64>"My heart starts to race, you know, and I tap her on the shoulder and she turns around and looks at me, and she had that kind of bashful dip [of her chin] that she did, and she looked up at me, and I said, 'Would you care to dance with me?'

I don't think I could have got through it," he recalled to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Telegraph</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/446a6b2c8e4d-john-travolta-the-shepherd-screening.jpg><p id=eVrNNwcgnmHB data-wc=63>"They [members of the Church] were with me every day after Jett died. They even travelled with me when I needed to get away. And for a solid two years it was like that. It was only in the second year that I started to take a break of a day or two just to see how I was doing on my own."</p><p id=eexcFf97AhBy data-wc=23>In 2023, it was rumored that John had begun to edge away from Scientology, however, the 70-year-old has refrained silent on the matter.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Legal battle&nbsp;</h3><p id=e0vtAe4wXJC0 data-wc=50>It's safe to say that John's had his fair share of legal battles, but 2012 saw the star embroiled in his biggest and most publicised lawsuit yet. In a headline-hitting case, the actor was hit with a sexual battery and harassment suit by two male masseurs, with each seeking $2million.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/8d3c9afb72db-john-travolta-wearing-navy-suit-2019.jpg><p id=ec_Zkv6Gy7ie data-wc=52>The pair – referred to as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 in court papers – accused the A-lister of making unwelcome sexual advances. Marty Singer, who served as John's lawyer, stated that the second claim was "just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one," and vehemently denied all charges.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSqEoUqBZjvm data-wc=47>Marty also explained that the first claim, which alleged that John had assaulted the plaintiff in LA, was "totally false and fabricated," evidenced by the fact that the star had been on the East Coast and working on a movie at the time of the alleged incident. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a37134dd86be-john-travolta-wearing-black-suit.jpg><p id=epgfRaMzJ7Y1 data-wc=19>Following the time discrepancy, John Doe withdrew from the lawsuit and by May 2012 both lawsuits had been dismissed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
