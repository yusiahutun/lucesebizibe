Despite his open nature regarding his religious beliefs, Quanell has been on most critics receiving end primarily due to his past life. As a Black-American activist, Quanell X is also both revered by many and loathed by some members of the community as well as the general public.</p><p class=align-left>A good example is <a href=# title="Quanell x biography" rel="nofollow noopener">last year’s case</a> between the activist and a mother who claims he solicited funds from them for legal services but never delivered. His life might be riddled with controversy, but Quanell X is one of the most successful activists of his time. We will get to his financial details later, for now, here are a few things you should know regarding Quanell’s early life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h2>Quanell X early life and Islam influence</h2><p class=align-left>Both of Quanell X’s parents were Nation of Islam converts. As a result, young Quanell had no choice but to embrace the religion, which contributed a lot to the way the activist turned out in life. Despite the religious influence he got from Islam, Quanell made some bad life choices to support his mother and younger brother when they moved to the southern part of Houston in Texas. His parents later denounced the Islamic faith and were against Quanell when he decided to join the Muslim brotherhood again back in 1990.</p><p class=align-left>Quanell drew inspiration from a <a id=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Quanell-X-marks-his-spot-Fiery-voice-takes-on-10832478.php#photo-11823602 href=# title="Quanell x" rel="nofollow noopener">speech by Louis</a> Farrakhan when he was addressing followers at the Sam Houston Coliseum. It wasn’t long before the controversial activist was a spokesman in the organization, which opened doors to a better lifestyle as opposed to selling drugs on street corners in Houston.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a134e33615cbe6f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dolvett Quince biography: wife, children, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e05b3268adef167.jpg><h2>Tragedy strike</h2><p class=align-left>Tragedy struck in July 1992 when Quanell’s brother Quinten Evans along with three of his friends was murdered in his apartment. Quanell was fortunate to meet Ron Wilson, a state representative at the time, who he served for a while as an aide. Quanell was a rolling stone at the time, as seen in his early remarks regarding the Jewish community. He later apologized for making such statements.</p><p class=align-left>Quanell’s <a href=# title="Quanell x" rel="nofollow noopener">harsh rhetoric</a> nature continued after he publicly incited war against white people by telling his followers to give whites hell from the womb to the tomb. His actions cost him a spot in the Nation of Islam movement, which kicked him out shortly after the remarks. Quanell then joined Mental Freedom Obtains Independence (MFOI), a paramilitary group that ironically did not attract too many freethinkers.</p><h2>The New Black Panther Nation leader</h2><p class=align-left>Just like the Nation of Islam, MFOI was not having any of Quanell X’s antics and shortly kicked him out of their organization. The activist then joined the New Black Panthers movement and became their leader after a short while. His mark was soon to be felt after the activist aided the peaceful surrender of the lots of criminals to the authorities. One of his most famous protests was staged in a courtroom at the hearing of James Bryd, Jr.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0672720540634685.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YNW Melly: net worth, height, mom, brother, songs, what happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As the leader of the New Black Panthers movement, Quanell thrust himself to the forefront of activism holding rallies and protests from different parts of the country. His vocal nature even aided in policy changes such as the March 2004 incident where he challenged the state to hand out reparations for people affected by slavery. Mayor Bill White had previously refused to agree to this demand, which made tempers flare and led to the forceful eviction of Quanell X from the panel.</p><h2>What does Quanell X do these days?</h2><p class=align-left>Quanell X is still one of the <a href=# title="Quanell x life" rel="nofollow noopener">most famous activists</a> in the United States as well as a part-time legal adviser. Several people have questioned his ability to serve as the latter after he allegedly got paid to deliver such services only to disappear with the money. The activist however categorically denied all the claims saying he has never told anyone that he is an attorney or claimed to have the ability to represent a client in that capacity. The lawsuit accusing Quanell X of duplicity was filed by Harris County and was the second of its kind.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><h2>Quanell X son</h2><p class=align-left>Quanell’s son is called Quanell X Jr is both a defensive and offensive player for the Pearland Freshman Eagles Youth Football Team. The number 7 is one of the standout performers in the team, and his father is very proud of his achievements. Quanell X trains the team's defense and as such, spends a lot of time with his talented son on the field. According to other coaches, Quanell X Jr is both skilled and has a great passion for the game; critical ingredients for success in the field.</p><h2>Quanell X net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Just like with many activists of today and self-employed individuals, calculating Quanell’s net worth can be tricky. However, a few sources claim the vocal activist and part-time defense coach was worth approximately $22 million. Most of his money comes from his job as a coach as well as his role as a civil rights activist and investigations aide. He might be an activist, but Quanell X cars show the man is living good and enjoying a good life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Quanell X might be controversial, but he has also helped his community significantly, especially with police-related cases. He has also helped a lot of youth lead positive lives as opposed to the life he used to lead as a young man.
