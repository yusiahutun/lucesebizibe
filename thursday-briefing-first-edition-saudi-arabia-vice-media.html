There have been notable reforms under his new regime. Women are allowed to drive; the guardian system – under which men have legal powers over women – has been relaxed; and cinemas reopened after 35 years.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>This apparent liberalisation did the trick, luring in western businesses, among them youth media company Vice, on whose site a video of a journalist embedded with the terrorist group Islamic State sits comfortably beside a story of a 76-year-old drilling a hole in their skull in an attempt to remain high forever. But then the mask slipped. The CIA accused MBS of approving the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, the rate of executions has <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">almost doubled</a> and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">women’s right activists have been jailed</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>So what does an upstart media company on the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">verge of bankruptcy</a> and with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">strong financial ties</a> to the kingdom do in response? Recent reporting claiming Vice is <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">blocking news stories</a> that could offend Saudi Arabia raises uncomfortable questions about the compromises companies are willing to make to do business with the kingdom, and the implications that has for British society.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>I spoke to Guardian media editor Jim Waterson to find out the answers.</p><h2 id=in-depth-a-lot-of-western-media-companies-saw-a-gold-rush-and-charged-in>In depth: ‘A lot of western media companies saw a gold rush and charged in’</h2><figure id=50356282-cca3-485d-b40c-bd53a57f9fbe data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>‘Vice is hiring many staff that live in Saudi Arabia’, but that may affect its ability to cover the news openly.</span> Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The media industry is undergoing one of its periodic financial struggles. Earlier this year, Vice <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">filed for bankruptcy protection</a>. Just a few weeks after, BuzzFeed <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">closed its news operation</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Vice, along with places like BuzzFeed, was one of the outlets that looked as if it had invented something new during the 2010s. It raised enormous sums of money from places like Disney and expanded very rapidly. Only a few years ago, it was valued at almost $6bn,” Jim says.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Vice convinced a lot of old-fashioned media outlets they had the youth audience captured – that their risk-taking, edgy view of the world was the one that young audiences wanted – and they could do news in a way that interested people. It turned out that that’s really expensive. Things started to get tough in media land; ad money dried up and there just wasn’t a profit to be had.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Vice is a somewhat awkward amalgamation, says Jim. It combines a news outlet, a website that does “edgy” content, with an advertising agency selling branded content, and it has a host of partnership deals in places such as Saudi Arabia, which want to make positive lifestyle content. Vice’s relationship with MBS and the Saudi government is an interesting one. Its co-founder Shane Smith met with the ruler in 2018, at the time when MBS came to power and was keen to diversify the Saudi economy.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“A lot of western media companies saw a gold rush and charged in,” Jim says. Saudi Arabia set up <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a number of partnerships with businesses in London</a> to improve its overseas image, including Vice. Separately, in 2019, the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Evening Standard</a> and the Independent were accused by the British government in court of being part-owned by the Saudi Arabian state.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The murder of Jamal Khashoggi a year later caused a lot of them to either pause or retreat because they’d been promised a new western focus, where the country would share their values, or what they perceive to be western liberal values. Instead you suddenly had a dead journalist and a state-backed murderer,” Jim says.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Jeremy Hunt, then foreign secretary, echoed the widespread condemnation of Khashoggi’s murder. Prominent business figures dropped out of a conference known as “Davos in the desert”, while Joe Biden said he would make the country a “pariah”, during his bid to become the Democratic’ presidential candidate.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“A lot of places either paused, dropped, or retreated from Saudi Arabia, including Vice. But the money remained on offer. Saudi could still pay far more than any struggling western company could for branded content or for investing in a news website and basically the finances won out,” Jim says.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>What are the ethical quandaries?</strong></p><figure id=a70dcca8-f3f6-44f3-9aee-4284fd6467d6 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>A billboard in January welcomes Cristiano Ronaldo to Al-Nassr FC.</span> Photograph: Ahmed Yosri/Reuters</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The rehabilitation of MBS was swift and widespread. Biden fist-bumped MBS in 2022, while the UK continues to court the kingdom for trade and investment. Vice secretly organised a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">lucrative music festival</a> in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert, with a budget of $20m. The lineup included French electronic musician Jean-Michel Jarre and rapper Tinie Tempah.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“If you’re running a struggling media company, and you can’t get ad revenue, Saudi Arabia will pay you tens of millions for hosting events or for doing a branded deal,” says Jim. “A lot of places are saying, ‘Sorry I’ve got to take the money’, and that’s the ethical quandary that Vice and others find themselves in.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Of course, this isn’t limited to media companies and governments. Saudi Arabia has spent at least <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">$6.3bn (£4.9bn) in sports deals</a> since early 2021. This includes the purchase of Newcastle United in 2021 by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) for roughly £300m, which sparked concerns from human rights groups. Critics have labelled this effort as “sportwashing”, an attempt by the regime to distract from its human rights record. The club’s ground, St James’ Park, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">will host two Saudi Arabia international friendly matches in September</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Saudi has undergone a transformation,” Jim says. “You can go to a big outdoor gig in the country in a way you couldn’t have done a decade ago. Men and women can mix to a certain extent. Women can drive. But, you can’t be openly gay, there’s still the death penalty, they still have a record of treating journalists terribly, and human rights abuses are commonplace.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“In the mind of Vice, or the justification that they offer, it’s that, ‘Saudi wants to open up and needs some help, and it’s our place to help them on this journey’. The flip side is: are you legitimising what is still a pretty horrible regime?”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>Who reports to whom?</strong></p><figure id=1593f706-7efe-49bf-be58-30618138ecb2 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>A map of Saudi Arabia hangs on the wall of Vice’s London office.</span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Jim’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">latest reporting</a> says that Vice has repeatedly blocked news stories that could offend the Saudi government. The news company’s reporters say they are unsure if they are able to report freely on the kingdom’s human rights abuses.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“As Vice is hiring so many staff who live in Saudi Arabia , the bosses keep saying to the news division, ‘Sorry, you can’t publish that because of the risks it poses to our staff in the country’,” Jim explains. It’s unsurprising that news editors don’t want to endanger staff in Saudi Arabia. “But if every time you publish something, you risk people on the ground, then you have essentially chosen that money over the ability to do news. I get the feeling that it’s a deal Vice on a corporate level are fine with.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>Trading credibility for cash</strong></p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“People haven’t quite realised that we’re playing with a country that has money on a level that we can’t really comprehend,” adds Jim. “The one thing that UK, US and other western countries have that Saudi craves is this respectability that can be offered by buying these institutions.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1w3z9oe>Sign up to <span>First Edition</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free daily newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
