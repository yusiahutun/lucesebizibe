at Taylor's fanbase&nbsp;for their comments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Along with accusing her of having plastic surgery to look like the singer, some 'Swifties' accused Ashley of 'stealing' Taylor's favourite number by putting '13' in her username.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Discussing the wave of online abuse, Ashley told Rolling Stone: 'A lot of the Swifties I have
