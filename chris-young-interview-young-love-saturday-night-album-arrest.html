Another <a href=#>social media post</a> thanked fans for sticking by him.</p><p>On the surface, it seemed like the public knew all there was to know.

Are you excited, nervous?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Chris Young: I mean, I’m not gonna be any more nervous than being falsely arrested by a TABC agent (laughs).</p><p><strong>You brought it up, not me.</strong></p><p>I don’t care (laughs).</p><p><strong>How do you look back at&nbsp;the incident now? Are you still upset? Embarrassed? Did it change anything for you?</strong></p><p>Embarrassment? On my behalf?</p><p><strong>I’m not suggesting —</strong></p><p>Bro, we've known each other for a long time. You’ve seen those videos. I didn’t do anything ... There’s more video that people haven’t seen, too.</p><p><strong>I got a sense of that.</strong></p><p>Yep, I didn’t want to put it out there. I wanted somebody else to put it out there instead of me, that way it wasn’t me going, "Hey, let me defend myself."</p><p><strong>How do you measure success with each album?</strong></p><p>I don’t know that I do. Everybody uses the phrase "moving the goal posts." I don’t know that the bar remains the same anymore with the advent of streaming.</p><p>Just being around as long as I have been is not normal (laughs). Especially not as you start at 20 years old. I’m just sitting there going, "Sweet. People still wanna hear my music."</p><p><strong>What is the song on this new album that you couldn’t have pulled off 10 or 15 years ago?</strong></p><p>Probably the current single, actually. Because "Young Love & Saturday Nights" — 10, 15 years ago they could have immediately jumped to — even though the family sold the catalog and he’s (<a href=#>David Bowie</a>) listed as a songwriter — they could have looked at me like, "Who’s this new guy trying to put out a David Bowie song with different lyrics?" That could have easily been the spin.</p><p><strong>What about a song like "Gettin' Older"? Do you think you were mature enough at age 20 to pull that off?</strong></p><p>I think I would’ve been OK with pulling that off, only because it’s about my dad. That’s how I feel about him. If I get a chance to be like him when I grow up, I’m not afraid of getting older. I think that’s something a lot of people can relate to.</p><p><strong>Do you want kids one day?</strong></p><p>Oh, I have no idea. I have a dog right now, that’s enough.</p><p><strong>I listen to "Call It a Day" and to a certain extent, "Don’t Stop Now." Have you ever toyed with the idea of doing a conceptual album that relies on that sexy sound that you’re known for?</strong></p><p>All I’m gonna say is if <a href=#>Keith Whitley</a> can do Sad Songs and Waltzes, I’m not taking it off the table that at some point I don’t just do bedroom songs, and they’re all sexy songs like "Call It a Day."</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Nashville Lifestyles Music In The City Featuring Chris Young</span></p>Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Are those songs easy for you to write?</strong></p><p>It depends. Sometimes I can write those every day, and sometimes I write ‘em and am like, "This song is not good enough." I feel like that’s every songwriter’s position.</p><p><strong>Do you write from personal experience or things happening around you?</strong></p><p>I normally write from personal experience, but not always. I’m never gonna cut off that lane.</p><p><strong>Is there an example of both on this album?</strong></p><p>Honestly, when you were talking about "Gettin' Older," the reason I got so pissed off that I didn’t write that is I was trying to write a song for my dad, and Dave Finley was writing with me and played me that song and I was like (sighs), "Dude, that’s what I was trying to write this whole time" (laughs).</p><p><strong>What did your dad think when he heard that song?</strong></p><p>He loved it.</p><p><strong>Is he the kind&nbsp;who would shed a few tears?</strong></p><p>I mean, my dad has a Dale Earnhardt mustache. He’ll have emotional moments but they’re very rare, and he got a little emotional about hearing that song.</p><p><strong>What else are you looking forward to in 2024?</strong></p><p>I’m just looking forward to a good year. I know that sounds really basic. I can laugh about the getting falsely arrested thing all I want, but I feel like 2024 kicked me in the nuts a little bit (laughs).</p><p><strong>You gotta win back your SEO. I Google your name and it’s all arrest content.</strong></p><p>Oh, don’t worry, I’m making a T-shirt. I’ll send you one.</p><p><strong>Maybe with your mug shot on it.</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s exactly what I’m talking about.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>11 Great Country Songs About Getting Arrested</h2><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Billy Dukes</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Sexy Country Songs - 40 of the Hottest Country Hits, Ranked</h2><p>This list of 40 sexy country songs prove that great country singers have been singing about intimacy for a long, long time.
