Using any headphones that you own you can use the pro audio enhancement app to redefine the way you listen to music. But what does this really mean?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watching your favorite flick on Netflix, YouTube, or Prime Video doesn't require you to sit in front of your TV with hundreds of dollars worth of surround sound equipment. Instead, with the Boom 3D app, you can enjoy immersive 3D surround sound without investing in any expensive hardware. From the anticipation of a stick breaking under someone's footsteps in near silence to loud gunshots in an action movie, you can enjoy a theatre-like experience from your home, using the desktop app.</p><p>But, that's not all, and Boom 3D isn't just for movie buffs. Regardless of the type of media player, you have on your computer, or streaming service you use, Boom 3D breathes new life into your music. Now you can appreciate every low bass tone, mid to high frequency, and rock out to your Spotify, Soundcloud, or streaming service playlist you have with pure clarity.</p><p>When it's time to indulge in some PC gaming, just pick up your headset and feel immersed in Boom 3D's multi-channel 3D surround sound. Gain an advantage over your opponents or simply admire the hustle and bustle of your favorite games without needing to spend money on a fancy headset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While you don't have to make use of the wealth of features Boom 3D has to offer to enjoy a state-of-the-art listening experience, it's definitely worth exploring what's on offer if you can. For example, you can explore a 31-band equalizer to fine-tune your audio experience, enjoy free access to more than 20,000 radio stations, or manage your app's volumes individually.</p><h2 id=how-does-boom-3d-work>How Does Boom 3D Work?</h2><p>Boom 3D is a piece of software that can completely change the way everything on your computer sounds, from music to movies, to games, to zoom chats.</p><p>The app uses a patented sound staging technology developed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Global Delight Technologies</a>, that helps create an immersive audio experience regardless of what headphones you're using.</p><p>This type of 3D surround sound has been something that's become the norm for living room entertainment centers, but you'd have to splash out quite a bit to have a great experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Netflix recently announced that it would start offering Spatial Audio on select content, basically allowing you to have an immersive experience when watching their shows. Apple is also providing Spatial Audio on select music content. Well, with Boom 3D you’ll get the same experience on all content, not just select titles or songs.</p><p>With Boom 3D, you get to enjoy such sound quality no matter what you're listening to and whether you spent $30 or $1,000 on your headphones. If we're being honest, this app makes spending too much on headphones unnecessary, although ultimately, that's something you'll have to decide on your own. Boom 3D can actually make ordinary headphones sound great.</p><h2 id=what-else-boom-3d-can-do>What Else Boom 3D Can Do</h2><p>Boom 3D can enhance any music you want to listen to, giving you the feeling of being surrounded by your favorites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=works-on-your-favorite-platforms>Works on Your Favorite Platforms</h3><p>Boom 3D is available for Windows & Mac For Mac and Windows, you can pay a one-time fee of $14.99 thanks to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">70% discount</a> currently available.

Once the week is over, you can opt for a subscription or a one-time purchase.</p><h3 id=volume-booster>Volume Booster</h3><p>It's not just how the music sounds that changes when using Boom 3D, but also the volume. The app will take the audio levels up a notch to deliver a crisper sound.</p><h3 id=3d-surround-sound>3D Surround Sound</h3><p>To feel fully immersed in whatever it is you're listening to, whether it be in-game music, your favorite tunes, or a movie, 3D surround sound is a must. Boom 3D uses innovative 3D surround sound technology to immersion from every angle.</p><p>And, if you're comfortable with making adjustments, you can adjust LFE (subwoofer) gain and the intensity of your audio. Listen to music the way it's meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=equalizer-presets>Equalizer Presets</h3><p>The app has many presets you can use for your tracks. Generally, it can automatically detect exactly what preset your track needs, but if you want to meddle and see which one you like best, you can choose between BassBoost, Acoustic, the '60s, Classical, Dubstep, Electronic, Flat, HipHop, House, Jazz, Loud, Music, Party, Pop, Reggae, Rock, Soft, Treble, Vocals, R&B, and Metal.</p><p>You can even decide which presets you want to see on the list and which ones you can go without. Take things one step further and arrange the presets in the order you want them to show up in the app. Obviously, your go-to preset should go at the top.</p><h3 id=advanced-audio-player>Advanced Audio Player</h3><p>If you have any downloaded music, Boom 3D will turn into a media player. Otherwise, it will work in the background to improve the sound on your device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=intensity-slider>Intensity Slider</h3><p>When listening to a track, just bring up the Boom 3D app and click on the 3D Surround feature. Once there, you can adjust the 3D audio intensity via a slider, as well as the bass levels. Play around with each slider to see what the optimum level is for you.</p><h3 id=remote-control>Remote Control</h3><p>When you have Boom 3D installed on your Mac computer, you can install the Boom Remote app on your iOS device. In this way, you'll get playback controls and the ability to adjust the volume levels from your phone even when you're away from your computer. The feature works with Spotify, VLC, QuickTime, and iTunes.</p><h3 id=turn-on-the-radio>Turn On the Radio</h3><p>It's not just music from Spotify or Tidal that you can listen to with Boom 3D. You can also go for the radio. The app features access to more than 20,000 local and international radio stations across 120 countries.</p><p>You can swap between them in a second, although it will take a bit to connect to each one. When listening to a radio station, you can also fiddle with the tempo, although that's not necessarily something you'll want to do as it will 'ruin' the song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=boost-system-fx>Boost System FX</h3><p>Perhaps one of the coolest features you can find on Boom 3D is the Boost System FX. This feature will use the inbuilt audio effects filter to enhance the sound from all the apps.</p><p>You can make your own personal adjustments, swapping between equalizer settings, bass, and loudness levels, and you can enable the virtualizer feature.</p><p>Basically, you'll get to play around with the Boom 3D features even when watching Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, or Disney Plus, to name a few. If you're used to playing music-based games, those will also get an awesome boost.</p><h2 id=is-it-worth-getting-boom-3d>Is It Worth Getting Boom 3D?</h2><p>Absolutely!
