He hangs out with his children while their mother gets some rest. At 4:45, Deborah and her brother Phillip head to a supermarket to buy baby food and boxed wine.</p><p class=align-left>At around 5 pm, Deborah and her brother returned home from shopping. At 5:30 pm, Jeremy leaves for a night job at a nearby Starbucks. Phillip also departs, leaving his sister with the next-door neighbour, Samantha Brando.</p><p class=align-left>At 6 pm, Samantha heads out to purchase more alcohol for the night. She returns at around 6:30 pm, and ten minutes later, at around 6:40 pm, Deborah puts the baby (Lisa) in her crib. Between around 6:40 pm and 10 pm, Deborah and Samantha sit on the porch drinking and smoking while the children play inside.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/298fc4518d8ca51b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Darlene Hulse?

He also discovers damage on the screen, his front door unlocked, and the computer room window pushed in. Jeremy rushes to check on his <a href=#>family</a>, noticing that Lisa is not in her crib.</p><p class=align-left>He wakes up Deborah to ask the whereabouts of their daughter. They search around the house and call 911 after failing to find her.</p><h2>Lisa Irwin's investigation</h2><p class=align-left>Following Lisa's disappearance, police began a multiple law enforcement agency investigation.
