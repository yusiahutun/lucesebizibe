The owners made us feel very at home.</p><p>“It has a family atmosphere, even though the people who go there probably aren’t related, unless they’re husband and wife.”</p><p>Asked if him and his partner engaged in swinging, he said: “Before lockdown, yeah – I have played with my partner, and my partner has played with others down there.</p><p>“But it won’t bother us if that doesn’t return. We will come here just to socialise.</p><p>'It’s somewhere you can get away from everything, where no one takes offence at what you think.

We do have regular customers who do come in and they have adhered to social distancing.”</p><p>Since reopening, guests face new safety measures including reduced capacity.</p><p>The owner added: “We have a maximum of 25 people in at once, including staff.</p><p>“We have two staff members working at any one time.</p><p>“Customers are temperature-checked before they come in.</p><p>"Areas are marked off for social bubbles of six people. We have markers in place so people don’t sit too close together.</p><p>“Everything is cleaned to probably a better standard than a restaurant.</p><p>"I’ve reduced numbers by the guidelines the council gave me.”</p><p>On the website, Route 69 is described as a "small, friendly and<br>welcoming club."</p><p>It continues: "Its intimate size and character makes it easy to mingle and get to know other guests."</p><p>There isn't a strict dress code, with a club FAQ stating that customers can wear what they like "so long as it's clean" and not work clothes.</p><p>A North Somerset council licensing officer spoke to the club after learning it had reopened.</p><p>He said: “The premises is licensed for the sale of alcohol under the Licensing Act and has been since 2014.</p><p>“Full risk assessments will be in place and the licence holder has advised these will be made available to myself or colleagues from other responsible authorities should we wish to view them.</p><p>“Pre-Covid the venue was being used as a meeting place for members of the swinging scene but as sex is not a licensable activity (nor when consenting couples allow others to watch in private) this does not require permission from the licensing authority.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGirp567qLHRrGScpKWXeqetzKKjsmWRqbqwv8%2BhnKudXaeysLzEp6pmamJrhXZ9lWk%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cinco-mayo-celebrated-blanca-blanco-bikini-exclusive-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cinco de Mayo celebrated by Blanca Blanco in bikini exclusive</a>
