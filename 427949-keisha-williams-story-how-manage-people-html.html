Keisha Williams from <i>American Greed </i>has one of the most bizarre stories of fraud. What happened?</p><h2>Who is Keisha Williams?</h2><p class=align-left>Keisha Williams is a 45-year-old (as of 2021) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">woman from Ashburn, Virginia</a>. She <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">has a degree</a> in <a href=#>Electrical Engineering</a> and Law. She shocked the entire world when it was discovered that she swindled $5 million in a healthcare investment scam whereby she promised investors significant returns.</p><p class=align-left>So, what happened to Keisha? She was arrested in 2018 after several victims reached out to authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) set up a sting that led to her arrest. The sting involved an agent posing as an investor who talked about the possibility of investing $12 million with Keisha’s consulting firm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15a2b6225ac6e847.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Izzy on Flip or Flop?

During the trial, Keisha admitted running a fraudulent healthcare software scheme that conned more than 50 individuals of their savings.</p><h2>How did Keisha Williams con people?</h2><p class=align-left>Keisha Williams’ con story starts like any other – the conception of an idea. So, what was her business idea? Four years before everything came out, Keisha stated that she was interested in buying Austrian software to allow doctors to talk to patients remotely.</p><p class=align-left>However, she didn't have enough money for the investment. Therefore, to purchase the product, she had to source funds, which she went out searching for investors.</p><p class=align-left>Keisha met California businessman Christian D’Andrade, who became her partner. He initially raised $4 million, which included $1.4 million of his money and another $1 million from other victims.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c6145e7fd8e3adf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lumify commercial cast: names, photos, and other TV roles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of her victims, Carla McPhun, a Maryland real estate investor, had no idea that the investment was a scam until he saw Keisha Williams of Ashburn VA, getting arrested.</p><p class=align-left>Keisha used her primary investors to lie to other potential investors about the significant <a href=#>returns</a> if they invested. For instance, McPhun lied to one investor about where the money was heading, thinking she would repay it soon.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Keisha lied to other people, both former air marshals. She convinced them to intimidate other people she claimed owed her money by still pretending to be federal agents.</p><p class=align-left>At one point, Keisha told D’Andrade that she was detained in Austria and couldn’t leave until she received $150,000 immediately. And she did not stop there; she scammed a 71-year-old cancer survivor $350,000, a special needs <a href=#>teacher</a>, and even a recent widow.</p><h2>How did Keisha spend the investment money?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fba3e432f2be68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shanna Mendiola: 7 facts about the NBC Los Angeles weather girl</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c9e75f9f87e869e0.jpg><p class=align-left>The conning is not even the worst part of Keisha's story; her expenditure is the most shocking.

Williams admitted spending about $7.5 million of her investor's money on luxury holidays, automobiles, restaurants and high-end shops. In addition, according to police records, she spent around $2.7 million on luxury travel and accessories from stores like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel.</p><p class=align-left>Keisha also used millions while residing at the Ritz-Carlton in the Bahamas, the Cavalieri in Rome. She even blew around $400,000 on a trip to Jamaica with her girlfriend. Also, she took an expensive <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday trip to Disney World</a>.</p><p class=align-left>And she wasn't even remorseful as she showed up in court during her criminal trial carrying a $1,800 Bottega Venetta portfolio, which she bought with her investor's money.
