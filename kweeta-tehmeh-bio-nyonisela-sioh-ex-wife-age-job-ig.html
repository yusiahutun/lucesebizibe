Here are a few things you need to know about her and his family. This article also unravels information on her relationship with her ex-husband.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about her!</p><h3><strong>Meet Kweeta Tehmeh, Nyonisela Sioh Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>Before the budding relationship of Nyonisela Sioh with ‘Real Housewives Of Atlanta’ star NeNe Leakes, he was previously married to his estranged ex-wife Kweeta Tehmeh. Nyonisela and his ex-wife chose to get married on his brother Francis K. Sio’s birthday which is on 9 November.</p><p>But, it remains unclear for how long they were in a relationship and stayed married together. While interviewing with Daily Guide Network in July 2020, Nyonisela had revealed that he was married and had three kids. So, it was after the interview they separated and filed for divorce.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Kweeta Tehmeh And Nyonisela Sioh Share?</strong></h3><p>Kweeta Tehmeh and Nyonisela Sioh shared at least one son named Nynonisela Sioh Jr. Whereas, Nyonisela has two children a <a href=#>son</a> and a <a href=#>daughter</a> from his previous relationship. While not much is known about his daughter, his son Michael Dennah is 20 years old who celebrates his birthday on 18 October.</p><p>Back in 2018, the owner of Nyoni Couture revealed that he went to London to see his son off to university.</p><h3><strong>What Is Kweeta Tehmeh’s Relationship Status?</strong></h3><p>Kweeta Tehmeh has separated herself from the internet world. She is not available on any of the social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook (@malomine), which she deleted after her husband’s relationship went viral. So, unearthing facts on whether she was seeing someone at the moment is impossible. She has been frequently featured on her family’s socials but there are no updates on her current status including her relationship.</p><p>Talking about her ex-husband, Nyonisela is dating NeNe Leakes. After the death of her husband, the reality star seems to have moved on after losing her husband in early September 2021.</p><p>NeNe appeared with a new guy, Nyonisela Sioh, proprietor of Nyoni Couture, for her 54th birthday in December 2021. A source close to both revealed to TMZ that the couple’s matchmaker was Peter Thomas, the ex-husband of fellow ‘RHOA’ star Cynthia Bailey.</p><p>However, it remains unclear for how long they have been dating each other.</p><p>NeNe’s Linnethia Lounge in Georgia, where she was surrounded by family, friends, and celebrities like Keke Wyatt and Porsha Williams, looked comfy together. Brentt, her son, planned the birthday celebration.</p><p>Nyonisela wore a striking lavender suit with a double-breasted jacket and peaked lapels, a white V-neck T-shirt, and casual brown shoes.</p><p>Following the birthday post, followers appeared to be less than enthusiastic about the growing romance. One user wrote on Facebook, “God! That was fast… If someone is the Love of my Life, I won’t be quick to be in another relationship. I’ll need time to heal”. Similarly, another wrote, “My sweet husband just died from cancer on Oct 21st and there is NO WAY I can even think about dating again, nonetheless do it”</p><p>However, NeNe hasn’t addressed the relationship herself.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Kweeta Tehmeh?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kweeta Tehmeh is over the age of 40 as of 2021.
