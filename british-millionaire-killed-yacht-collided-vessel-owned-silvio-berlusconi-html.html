former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi have recommended both captains be charged with manslaughter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Millionaire businessman Dean Kronsbein, 61, suffered fatal injuries after he was thrown to the ground when his yacht the Amore smashed into rocks after it took evasive action to avoid Berlusconi's Sweet Dragon boat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Following an 11-month investigation, prosecutors on the Italian island of Sardinia, <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>where the tragedy happened,</a> have closed their case and have advocated Mario Lallone, 68, the captain of the Amore and Lugi Cortese, 58, at the helm of the Sweet Dragon, be charged with manslaughter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition, the file also recommends both also be formally accused with causing a disaster and non-observance of maritime safety regulations.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutor Gregorio Capasso accuses both men of 'negligence, imprudence and inexperience' in his report which will now go before an investigating magistrate at Tempio Pausania on Sardinia to be rubber stamped, with a trial expected later in the year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He described how both yachts were sailing fast 'at between 26-28 knots' in a stretch of water where it was forbidden to navigate just off a chain of islands known as Li Nibani, on the north-east coast of the millionaires' playground.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Both vessels were sailing in the opposite direction when they suddenly came face to face and the skipper of the Amore should have steered left but instead steered right smashing into the rocks as he fought to take evasive action.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The captain of the 70ft Sweet Dragon has insisted he was following correct nautical procedures and that he had to carry out a drastic manoeuvre to avoid smashing into the 88ft Amore, owned by Mr Kronsbein, who was from Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the incident last July, his wife Sabine, 60, and daughter Sophia, 28, were also injured and they had to be airlifted to hospital but were later released and flown back to the UK.</p><img id=i-6f2cfdae9fff90b0
