This means that physically attractive people might be assumed to be smarter, more competent, and more likeable, and this can be associated with being treated better.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There is evidence that this affects advancement in the workplace, including being more likely to get promoted or make more money. Given that our physical appearance is one of the first things people experience when we meet them, it makes sense that it has a strong impact on others' perception of us, especially early on.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There is evidence that a bias towards beauty exists in cultures around the world, not just ours, although each culture's definition of beauty is different.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'While research demonstrates that being attractive can be associated with positive outcomes, this doesn't mean it also doesn't come with negatives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When we have limited information about someone, it is human nature to make snap judgments about them in order to try to best navigate the situation. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads us to wrongly assume things.
