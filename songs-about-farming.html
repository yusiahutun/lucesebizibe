It hit number 1 on both the Billboard Hot Country Singles and Hot 100 charts.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm/A raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm/My days are all filled with an easy country charm/Thank God I'm a country boy."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">2</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"High Cotton," Alabama, 1989</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Alabama's 1989 hit speaks to the simple comforts of childhood, despite hardships, while growing up on a farm. In the music video, the members of the band drive past scenes from rural America, from kids boarding the county bus for school to farmers plowing their fields.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "We were walkin' in high cotton/Old times there are not forgotten/Those fertile fields are never far away."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">3</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Alabama Clay," Garth Brooks, 1989</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">This song from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a36629896/garth-brooks-the-dance-kelly-clarkson-trisha-yearwood-reaction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Garth Brook" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Garth Brook</a>'s debut album tells the story of a young man who leaves his family's farm for life in the city, only to find unhappiness in factory work. Eventually feels the draw of home and the red Alabama clay. While the song was never released as a single, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theboot.com/garth-brooks-alabama-clay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brooks has said it's a fan favorite" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Brooks has said it's a fan favorite</a> he often gets requests for.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "His neck is red as Alabama clay/Now he's goin' home this time to stay/Where the roots run deep on the family tree/And the tractor rolls through the fields of green."</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">4</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Heartland," George Strait, 1993</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">George Strait pays tribute to the culture and nature of the Midwest, including the fields a farmer "Works until the daylight's gone." It touched a chord with listeners, and the song went to the top of the Billboard Hot County Songs chart.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "Sing a song about the Heartland/The only place I feel at home/Sing about the way a good man/Works until the daylight's gone."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">5</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Where Corn Don't Grow," Travis Tritt, 1996</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Travis Tritt lends his voice to this song about a father explaining to his son that, just because he heads to a place "where corn don't grow," doesn't mean he'll be leaving behind his problems. Tritt first recorded the song for his 1996 album The Restless Kind, and performed it again for his 2016 concert album A Man and His Guitar (Live from the Franklin Theatre).</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "Hard times are real/There's dusty fields no matter where you go/You may change your mind/'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">6</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Where the Green Grass Grows," Tim McGraw, 1997</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The fiddle at the start of Tim McGraw's song (the first on his chart-topping album, Everywhere) kicks off one of the catchiest tributes to the simple pleasures of farm life ever recorded. The lyrics lament the daily grind of city living and paint a pretty picture of a life spent on a farm with loved ones.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "I'm gonna live where the green grass grows/Watch my corn pop up in rows/Every night be tucked in close to you."<br></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">7</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Daddy Won't Sell the Farm," Montgomery Gentry, 1999</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Country duo Montgomery Gentry sing the story of a family patriarch unwilling to part with his farmland despite offers from urban developers. While there's certainly a sense of humor at play here ("Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls/When they're downwind from his hogs") the song is ultimately about sticking to your guns and standing up for the land you love.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "When his tractor backs up traffic/the reception ain't too warm/The city's growing around him/but Daddy won't sell the farm."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">8</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy," Kenny Chesney, 1999</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Kenny Chesney is clearly having a lot of fun with this 1999 single about a woman who appreciates his, ahem, farming equipment. Listeners liked it too, with the song breaking into the top 12 of Billboard's Hot Country Songs.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "Well, she ain't into cars or pick up trucks/But if it runs like a Deere, man her eyes light up."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">9</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Amarillo Sky," Jason Aldean, 2005</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The music video for "Amarillo Sky" starts off with short interviews of third-and-fourth generation farmers, young men who love their land and farming way of life. Jason Aldean follows with a song about the hardship of making a living in modern farming. It's also a tribute to the people who keep at it, day-in and day-out.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "And diesel's worth the price of gold/It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold/But he's still holding on/He just takes the tractor another round/And pulls the plow across the ground."</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">10</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"International Harvester," Craig Morgan, 2006</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Craig Morgan's upbeat tune about life as a third-generation farmer is full of swagger and pride for the job. It even kicks off with the sounds of farm equipment powering up.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "I'm the son of a 3rd generation farmer/I've been married 10 years to the farmer's daughter/I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver/Hoggin' up the road on my p-p-p-p-plower/Chug a lug a luggin' 5 miles an hour/On my International Harvester."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">11</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"A Man on a Tractor," Rodney Atkins, 2006</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">In this song, Rodney Atkins wishes he could feel as fulfilled as the man he sees out in the field on a tractor doing what he loves: farming with his dog. Eventually, he realizes the change he needs isn't literally to go out and get his own tractor, but to find the same contentment as the farmer in his own life.</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Farm-friendly lyrics: "His work was laid out there before him/In rows of green; his whole life was revealed/Oh, what I wouldn't give if I could just live/Like a man on a tractor with a dog in a field."</p><span class="css-3douet e1tmud0h4">12</span><h2 class="css-1weljep e1tmud0h7">"Here's to the Farmer," Luke Bryan, 2016</h2><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.countryliving.com/search/?q=luke+bryan" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Luke Bryan" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Luke Bryan</a> was brought up in rural Georgia and farming is a subject that's near and dear to his heart.
