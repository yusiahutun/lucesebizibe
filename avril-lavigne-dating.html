The ring features two engravings: “Hi Icon” which were the first words that Smith said to Lavigne, along with the couple’s names engraved on the inside.</p><p>The cut of the ring is super unique and sentimental to the couple: “He knew from the very beginning I wanted a heart-shaped diamond because on the day we met, we had matching heart-shaped paved rings on. We’ve worn them every day since, so it’s only fitting to have a heart-shaped engagement ring. I love it so much.”</p><p>Sources close to the couple told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the couple<a href=# rel=noopener> called it quits</a> in February 2023 after pictures emerged of the “Girlfriend” singer hugging Tyga via<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> TMZ.</a> “Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months, but are no longer together as a couple,” said an insider. Another source set the record straight to say no infidelity had occurred. They added, in response to photos of Lavigne hugging the rapper after they shared a meal together that, “Avril and Tyga are genuinely friends and nothing more. There was absolutely no third party involved in the split.”</p><p>On February 28, 2023, the “Flames” singer posted on<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Instagram,</a> “In 1 week my entire life completely changed…I just know there’s a plan for it all. I’ll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken 💔 Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.” Shortly after the breakup became public, Mod Sun’s reps told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> after Lavigne’s reps confirmed the breakup to the outlet, “They were together and engaged as of three days ago when he left for tour, so if anything has changed, that’s news to him.”</p><h2>Pete Jonas (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/avril-lavigne-pete-Jonas-e1677078325560.jpg><p>Avril Lavigne briefly dated indie musician Pete Jonas in 2020 after they were spotted at Clive Davis’ annual pre-Grammy gala, though the two never publicly commented on their relationship status.</p><h2>Phillip Sarofim (2018-2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Avril-Lavigne-Phillip-Sarofim-e1677079028829.jpg><p>Avril Lavigne dated the son of billionaire Fayez Sarofim, Philip Sarofim from 2018 to 2019. Sources told E! Online that the two met through friends at a party and hit it off. The two were spotted PDA-ing it up at Lake Como, Italy. Though their relationship ended shortly after their one-year anniversary which was on Valentine’s Day.</p><h2>Chad Kroeger (2012 – 2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Avril-Lavigne-Chad-Kroeger.jpg><p>Avril Lavigne dated and married Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger.

The couple got married a year later on Canada Day 2013. In true Canadian fashion, they married in a Canadian medieval castle surrounded by about 100 friends and family members.</p><p>The couple called it quits three years later when they announced their separation on Instagram in 2015. “Through not only the marriage, but the music as well, we’ve created many unforgettable moments,” she wrote. “We are still, and forever will be, the best of friends, and will always care deeply for each other.”</p><p>Though they split, the “What the Hell?” singer is very close to her ex. “They’re just good people,” Avril told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> USA Today</a> of her exes. “We had marriages, we lived together, I knew their families, they knew mine, we just stayed close and there’s a mutual respect. Chad, in particular, we’re actually really close, because that was a more recent relationship. He was with me through a lot and is a really protective person in my life. He’s still like family. I didn’t know that it would be that way, and I’m really glad it is because we were friends and we made music together (including 2013 duet “Let Me Go”). We’ve just kept the friendship and continued having a working relationship, as well.”</p><h2><span>Brody Jenner (2010 – 2012)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/avril-lavigne-brody-jenner.jpg><p>Avril Lavigne dated Brody Jenner from 2010 to 2012.

He gave me my first shot of Jäger. I had a tie on — it was back in the days of the tie. I was 17. As I was getting carried out of the bar I saw Chad from Nickelback! Isn’t that funny?”</p><p>The two musicians tied the knot in their private estate in Montecito, California in 2006. Three years later, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the reason for divorce was because she was too young. “She married too young and she finally realized that,” says a source. “Avril realized she needs her own life and needs to explore things without him.”</p><p>Avril wrote a statement on her website about their separation. “We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21. I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship. I admire Deryck and have a great amount of respect for him.
