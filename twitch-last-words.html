We had no indication that anything was out of the ordinary.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He continued, He was a very humble, generous person. He brought light into everybody’s lives. We’re completely devastated right now. All I can say is he was a beautiful person that contributed so much to this world and to everyone he met in a positive way. We miss him dearly and we’re hurting tremendously.”</p><p>Eddy, who traveled from Arizona to Los Angeles to be with tWitch’s family after his death, also revealed the last text tWitch sent to him before he committed suicide. “Every word has meaning. His last words to me were a simple text that says “I love you Dad-Dad.” Our question is why? Where did it come from?” he said. Eddy also told The Daily Mail that he was still “not sure” tWitch’s death was a suicide despite the Los Angeles Police Department confirming that his grandson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><h2>How did tWitch die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stephen-Twitch-Boss-5.jpg><p>How did tWitch die? tWitch’s wife, Allison Holker, confirmed her husband’s death in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on December 14, 2022. He was 40 years old. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,” Holker said in a statement. “Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.” She continued, “To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt. I am certain there won’t be a day that goes by that we won’t honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.” She ended her statement with a message to her husband.”Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you,” she said.</p><p>tWitch’s cause of death was ruled a suicide by a gunshot wound to the head, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner reported “no signs of foul play” and the case has been officially closed. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> also reported that a suicide note was found at the scene of tWitch’s death, in which he wrote ambiguously about his past struggles and challenges.</p><p>Law enforcement sources told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> that tWitch’s wife, Allison Holker, ran into a Los Angeles Police Department station on December 13, 2022, frantic because tWitch had left their house without his car, which wasn’t like him. At around 11:15 a.m. PT, paramedics received a call for a medical emergency at the Oak Tree Inn in Encino, California—less than a mile tWitch and Holker’s home—where he was found dead in the bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead on the scene.</p><p>Sources told TMZ that tWitch checked into the motel on the morning of December 12, 2022, a day before his death. He took an Uber from his home to the motel and switched his phone to airplane mode, so no one could contact or track him. Motel staffers told TMZ that tWitch didn’t seem in “distress” and wasn’t “visibly upset” when he arrived at the hotel. Staffers also told TMZ that he came with a small bag and booked the room for just one night. When he missed his checkout time at 11 a.m. PT and didn’t respond to the motel staff’s calls on December 13, 2022, housekeeping and management knocked “repeatedly” on tWitch’s door. When there was no answer, management opened the door, saw a body on the floor and immediately called police. The staffers told TMZ that they didn’t hear a gunshot during tWitch’s stay as the motel’s layout has separate units and the structure is in a U-shape. The motel’s manager also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> that the Oak Tree Inn didn’t rent out rooms for a week following tWitch’s death. The employee also confirmed that tWitch was alone and that “everything was normal, nothing was weird” the day tWitch’s body was found.</p><p>“On Dec. 13, 2022 at around 11:20 a.m., West Valley Division officers responded to an ‘Ambulance Death Investigation’ radio call at a motel. Investigators determined that the deceased died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and there were no signs of foul play. The case was handed over to the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office,” a representative for the Los Angeles Police Department told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.
