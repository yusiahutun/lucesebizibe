There is an interesting thing about people who have hit the other end of the spectrum, who’ve lived their lives, they’ve raised their kids, some have been widowed or divorced and maybe some have never been in love. We thought that would be an interesting dynamic through the Bachelor prism.”</p><p>Gerry Turner, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Indiana, was announced as the Season 1 Golden Bachelor on Good Morning America in July 2023. “It’s never too late to fall in love again,” he said.&nbsp;Gerry is a father, grandfather, and widower. He married his wife and high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. They share two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. Gerry and Toni were married for 43 years until her death from an illness in 2017, six weeks after her retirement. “She got robbed,” Gerry told Good Morning America about Toni. “Every day that goes by, that’s the thought I have.”</p><p>When asked what Toni would think of him starring on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Golden Bachelor</a>, Gerry told Good Morning America that he believed his late wife would be “rooting” for him. “I have her picture on a dresser in my closet,” he said. “Every morning I give her the nod, ‘So what do you think about this?’ For a while it was like I was having a hard time figuring out if she would be OK. But we always told each other, when one of us goes, we want the other one to be happy.” He continued, “She’s saying, ‘Yeah Gerry, do this.’”</p><p>But back to Kathy on The Golden Bachelor.

The answer is no. Gerry Turner does not give his Final Rose to Kathy Swarts on The Golden Bachelor Season 1, according to Reality Steve. While Reality Steve hasn’t confirmed Gerry’s winner on The Golden Bachelor, he reported that Gerry’s final two are: Theresa Nist, a 69-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey; and Leslie Fhima, a 64-year-old fitness instructor from Minneapolis, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>In Episode 3 of The Golden Bachelor Season 1, Kathy and Gerry had a conversation about her father. “This is my dad. I was about 30 there. He taught me hard work and being a good person is what matters,” Kathy told Gerry. “I’ve had a rough day.” Gerry responded, “You have? You’re an incredibly positive and upbeat person.” Kathy continued, “My biggest goal for you is to be happy. I want you to be happy. It’s the truth.”</p><p>In a confessional interview after their conversation, Gerry confessed that he had developed romantic feelings for Kathy. “I learned a whole new side of Kathy. I now have become romantically attracted to her rather than just looking at her like a good friend,” he said.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfoK61tNhmnqiklJq7bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./frankie-shop-quilted-jacket.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why Everyone's Wearing This Coat</a>
