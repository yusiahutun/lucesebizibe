wedding speech to announce that he plans to bury the hatchet and endorse one of his Republican foes Mike DeWine, who is running to retain his position as Ohio governor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It marks a turnaround for Trump who based DeWine as a 'terrible, terrible guy' at a rally in the state in April.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And he previously steered clear of offering any endorsement as DeWine - one of the first senior Republicans to admit that Joe Biden had won the 2020 election, and who was criticized by others in the party for his robust pandemic lockdown measures - faced Trumpy rivals in the party primary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But on Saturday, in typically unconventional fashion, the former president used a wedding at his New Jersey golf club to announce that all was forgiven.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An attendee at Bedminster Golf Club said, his speech praised groom Max Miller, a former aide who is now running for an Ohio House seat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He told Max let your governor know I'm going to support him and he trashed the Democratic candidate, who was mayor and was nasty to him when he visited Ohio,' said the guest.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He said to Max, let him know I'm going to be backing him all the way.'</p><img id=i-749b1a508170f182
