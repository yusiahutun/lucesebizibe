The series explores themes of family, relationships, and identity against the backdrop of a picturesque New England town.

The series’ second season spent two weeks at #1 on Netflix.</p><p>The good news? There will be a season three and four. <strong>**Spoilers** </strong>The shocking season two finale — which saw Georgia arrested at her own wedding after she suffocated a comatose Tom with a pillow to spare his family from further suffering — will directly set the stage for the show’s third season set to release in 2025.</p><p>Show creator Lampert told Tudum that Season 3 will throw “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new hurdles, new relationships and new challenges </a>in a way we haven’t seen before on the show.”</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> In real life, Antonia Gentry, who plays Ginny, and Brianne Howey, who plays Georgia, are only eight years apart in age.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>10 Best Comedy Series on Netflix, Ranked — All Sure to Leave You in Stitches</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brianne Howey as Georgia Miller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/1_2e5d85.jpg><p>Born in 1989 in Los Angeles, California, Brianne Howey had bit parts in shows like 90210 (2010), NCIS (2011) and Criminal Minds (2013) before being cast in The Exorcist (2016). She also appeared in the tv series The Passage (2019) and Dollface (2019-2022) before getting the role of Georgia in the Ginny and Georgia cast.</p><p>Of season two, Howey told Glamour, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was stretched in ways I didn’t even know I was capable of</a>. There’s a heavy responsibility with telling some of the more nuanced storylines and we don’t take it lightly. It’s also very important to us that these storylines aren’t glorified. As an actor it isn’t easy, going to places in your life that you’re drawing from and everybody responds differently, but I am one of those people—it sticks with me a little bit. I’m an emotional being. I go home and it’s hard to turn it off.”</p><p>The show’s subject matter can be intense. They cover everything from sexism to racism,&nbsp;self-harm&nbsp;to abuse. And it’s attracting a multigenerational audience, getting mothers, daughters, and grandmothers to talk about social issues. Says Howey, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We don’t necessarily have all of the answers,</a> but the fact that the show can start the conversation is a really beautiful step.”</p><p>In her personal life, Howey has been married to Matt Ziering since 2021 and they have one child.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>‘Criminal Minds’ Cast Then and Now: Catch Up With The Agents of the B.A.U.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antonia Gentry as Ginny Miller in the Ginny and Georgia cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_4d61f4.jpg><p>Born on September 25, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, Antonia Gentry got her acting start doing a PSA (Public Service Announcement) on texting and driving in 2014.

Then, in 2019 she appeared in an episode of Raising Dion.</p><p>Getting the role of Ginny Miller in the Ginny and Georgia cast&nbsp;was her big break.</p><p>She told Numero Netherlands that the show is much bigger than she envisioned. She said, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I think our show, even though when filming it we primarily thought that it was going to be just for a YA</a> (young adult) audience, it includes so many characters that have such a vast array of experiences that I think the demographic ended up being much broader than we thought.”</p><p>Gentry is also trying to balance new-found fame. She said, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s really surreal.</a> I’m very grateful that people love the show and that my life has changed in a mostly positive way. This is something that I don’t think I ever believed would happen, at least so soon after graduating college. I’m still trying to figure out what I’m doing, but I thought it’d be a lot less lucky than I am. It’s been nice, but it’s also been kind of overwhelming. It’s a huge adjustment. I’m a very private person. I’m very quiet and introverted in real life. And so being recognized on the street is nice and the fans are lovely and it’s always great to see, but it also is kind of nerve wracking.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Diesel La Torraca as Austin Miller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/3_3c8ef8.jpg><p>Born in 2011, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diesel La Torraca</a> is an Australian-American actor, who started working in the entertainment industry at a very young age.
