"The Situation" in prison, his relationship with Nikki from 'Double Shot at Love' and the current state of his famously pierced penis.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>Pauly D</a></strong> was an open book during a Thursday night appearance on "Watch What Happens Live," talking about everything from which reality stars he would "smush" and the state of his famous Prince Albert penis piercing.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong> kicked things off by asking him a series of questions about his <strong><a href=#>"Jersey Shore"</a></strong> cast-mates and which of them he would want to be there for him in varying situations like bailing him out of jail (<strong><a href=#>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</a></strong>), joining him in a threesome (<strong><a href=#>Ronnie

"Those are my sisters, oh man," he said. But after a few moments to think about it, he settled on the perfect solution: "Threesome!"</p><p>Pauly was even asked which of the OG guys hooked up with the most chicks during their MTV heyday, him or <strong><a href=#>Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino</a></strong>. At first, Pauly totally pleaded the fifth, but that only lasted a second ... and this isn't that game anyway, Pauly!</p><p>"Yo, Mike was a savage back in the day," Pauly admitted.

"It wasn't the case. It was very laid back." He said he was even allowed to keep his phone with him during the visit.</p><p>As for Mike, Pauly said "he's happy, positive.

Pauly's answer for every single one of them was delivered with increasing gales of laughter: "Smushy!"</p><p>Honestly, how do you expect the guy to diss one of these women like that on national television? Of course he was going to say they were all smush-able, unless he wanted to create a "Housewives" feud with the "Shore." Actually, we'd be down for a "RHONJ" crossover with the "Shore" gang. Maybe Pauly could drop by and offer to smush them all.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5f151261-0991-54d7-bdf5-799b8cdd512c data-container-ref=toofab:article:e6acf3f3-48d7-5910-ab15-7ecbdc5dffbd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0a/5by4/2019/07/11/0a921b66119d535fb2dbd45b6b98aeb6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Jersey Shore' Recap: Mike Gets Sentenced, Ronnie Gets Jumped, JWoww Snaps Over Questions About Her Divorce</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>The Prince-less Albert</h2><p>Girlfriends and hookups have been talking about it for years, but Andy Cohen wanted to hear it from the DJ's mouth, so he asked Pauly, "Is it true that you pierced your penis"</p><p>As there's no point in lying about it now, Pauly easily admitted to it. But when Andy marveled that he has a Prince Albert (we'll not explain that here, good people!), Pauly clarified the tense.</p><p>"Not anymore," he said.

In the show, Pauly and fellow "Jersey Shore" cast-mate Vinny Guadagnino pared down a group of contestants in an attempt to find love. Vinny was able to choose someone, though they've since broken up, but Pauly ended the show by eliminating both of his finalists, including Nikki Hall.</p><p>Nikki gained some notoriety among "Jersey" fans when she shared a bunch of text messages she purported were between her and Pauly, refuting his stance that there just wasn't a connection between them. She claims the messages prove he was as into her as she was into him. If they are from him, she has a solid argument.</p><p>So it was actually a great question to get his take on her leaking those messages and find out where Pauly stands with Nikki today. "We left sort of on bad terms," Pauly said. "We talked a little bit after the show but it never really amounted to anything and I think that really got her mad."</p><p>The closest he came to addressing any of the specifics was when he said, "I saw a lot of red flags there, so I distanced myself and I'm kind of sticking with that, distancing myself from that whole thing." In other words, he's not going to spill that tea. You can almost feel Andy's sadness from here. He hates when tea stays firmly in teacups.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
