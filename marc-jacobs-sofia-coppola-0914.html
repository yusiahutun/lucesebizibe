emevuu60">Perched on a rooftop in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood one afternoon in early May, Sofia Coppola is ticking off some of the big moments in her life that have involved her good friend Marc Jacobs. There's the dress she wore the night she won an Oscar for screenwriting for Lost in Translation. (Jacobs designed it.) Then there's the one she wore to the rehearsal dinner before her wedding to her first husband, the director Spike Jonze. (He designed that dress too.) The memories are of a seemingly unending stream of concerts and music festivals, house parties and black-tie galas, and fashion shows and excursions with Coppola's current husband of three years, Thomas Mars of the French band Phoenix, and their two young daughters, Romy and Cosima.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of Coppola's favorite times with Jacobs, though, was more subtly satisfying. She puts down the sandwich she's eating and smiles as she recalls when, a few years ago, he invited her to a dinner at his apartment in Paris's Seventh Arrondissement. "I loved that," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She arrived in a mink coat," interjects Jacobs, who is smoking a cigarette nearby. "I answered the door, and she said, 'When did we start having such bourgeois evenings?' "</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was so beautiful and grown-up," Coppola adds. "And silly."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The tale of Marc and Sofia is one of fashion's great platonic love stories. The two first met during the heady days of the early 1990s, when Jacobs was designing for Perry Ellis. He was a promising young talent who had yet to be fired after presenting his now legendary "grunge" collection; she was a young woman who was trying to chart her own path and who'd asked her mother, Eleanor, if they could go to one of his shows. Afterward mom and daughter went backstage to meet the designer, and Jacobs and Coppola began to chat. They quickly discovered that they had similar tastes in music and art, and in the process casually struck up what has become a defining designer-muse relationship for both of them. He would soon build his own internationally renowned label and embark on a prodigious 16-year run designing for Louis Vuitton. She would follow in the substantial footsteps of her father, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and become an acclaimed filmmaker in her own right.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span> "When friendships are genuine they last." —Marc Jacobs<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More than two decades on, Jacobs and Coppola are as close as they've ever been. Indeed, theirs is the kind of bond that took them to this year's Met Gala with a tight-knit posse, including the artists Rachel Feinstein and John Currin and the actress Jessica Lange. But amid all the declarative glamour, what Jacobs and Coppola say they remember most is being completely engrossed in their own little group—apart from one fleeting lapse when, Jacobs says, "we were distracted for a moment by Kate Upton's bosom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When friendships are genuine, they last—it's really that simple," he continues. "In fashion, there is certainly a percentage of people who don't have the loyalty and integrity in a relationship. They're looking over their shoulder. They're being superficial. But when you meet people that you genuinely like, and there's authenticity, it lasts, and it's not an effort to maintain a relationship."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the personal nature of their friendship, the pair have never shied away from working together too, collaborating on campaigns, accessories, and collections for Jacobs's line as well as for Vuitton during his tenure at the house. In 2001, he enlisted Coppola to be the face of his first fragrance. Juergen Teller shot the images for the campaign during a drive up the West Coast. "Some of them were taken in my pool, when I lived in L.A., and then we did a road trip up to Big Sur," Coppola recalls wistfully. "It was just a fun, lost weekend—an escape from real life. I have good memories from that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recently Coppola stepped behind the camera to direct a commercial for Daisy Dream, a companion to Jacobs's sister scent, Daisy (named for his favorite female literary character, The Great Gatsby's Daisy Buchanan)—and an appropriately named one at that, given the airy, vaguely metaphysical mood the designer seems to be in this season. After all, at his show during New York Fashion Week in February, he had the audience in the clouds—literally. He had arranged the seating so that everyone sat on single-person poufs surrounded by cartoonish, pastel-colored clusters of cumuli, which dangled overhead like thought bubbles.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span> "There's an implicit trust..Marc feels like family." —Sofia Coppola<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The clip for Daisy Dream is quintessential Coppola: otherworldly and full of wanderlust, as an innocent-looking model traipses in the sun through bright Bavarian fields and gazes longingly into her lens. (Think The Virgin Suicides meets Little House on the Prairie.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coppola directed the spot after hopping over to Germany from Italy during a family vacation. "It was really fun to think about the imagery of what Marc wanted," she says. "A lot of dreaming is involved in what I do. I guess with the fragrance, you imagine the woman you're going to be when you wear it. Part of the experience when you wear this fragrance is that you think about a life you're going to have. That's what fashion is too."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dreams, it seems—and the possibilities they represent—have been weighing heavily on Jacobs of late, having left his post as artistic director of Vuitton last October to refocus on his own company, which he plans to take public. "A dream is supposed to be what's not real—or what's not real yet," he says reflectively. "We're talking about something that is ethereal, taking you outside where you are physically. And which seems like the right world." Then he takes a long drag on a cigarette. "But let's get one thing straight—I don't just have my head in the clouds."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's an implicit trust," Coppola says of working with Jacobs, adding that she's proud of how they've continued to inspire and influence each other "through all the incarnations and hairstyles," from all the way back in their grungy days to now, when "I'm just a middle-aged mom," she jokes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Marc feels like family to me," adds Coppola. "He's like a cousin. When we see each other, we start off where we left off. I'm still constantly learning from him." The same thing goes for Jacobs. "I'm always interested in people who are interesting," he says. "And interested."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His all-time-favorite Coppola memory? Halloween in L.A. in the late 1990s. "The idea was that all the adults had to get costumes from the kids' shop," he recalls. "I was a Teletubby. But Sofia was somewhere else and asked me to buy her a costume, so I got her a little policeman outfit, which ended up fitting her like a glove. It was navy with gold buttons, an all-in-one stretch jumpsuit." He sighs. "Only she could make a kid's costume look like the chicest thing in the world."</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWNmg3p7zJqpnGWalrCwrtJmqqiemZZ6pLvPqaalmV1lhnKAjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./giannis-antetokounmpo-wife.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Giannis Antetokounmpo Wife?
