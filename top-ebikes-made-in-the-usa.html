These electrified bikes can function in an urban environment as a primary form of transportation and in a more adventurous setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you want to replace your traditional mountain bike for those weekend camping trips or you rely on your bike for everyday use, purchasing one made in the USA can be a great choice. So, check out this list of some of the best e-bikes built in the USA.</p><h2 id=optibike-r22-everest>1. Optibike R22 Everest</h2><p>The Optibike R22 Everest is as impressive as its name implies. This bike is the <a href=#>Lucid Air</a> of e-bikes. If it were a car, it would definitely be on the list of <a href=#>EVs with the longest range</a>. The R22 Everest is built in Colorado, so it meets the criteria of this list. This e-bike can travel approximately 300 miles on a single charge (estimated while using a 160 lb driver traveling at 15 mph with pedal assist), thanks to its humongous 3,260Wh battery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This battery is what makes the R22 Everest shine above and beyond the competition when it comes to range. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Optibike</a> explains that the battery has a switch that allows the cyclist to activate the battery case's other 1,630Wh battery when the one powering the bike is depleted. They call this "Out and Back" technology.</p><p>It features our ‘Out and Back’ technology, with a switch to swap between 2 separate 1630 Wh batteries both in the same case. You can ride out with 1 battery, and be confident that you still have another full battery left over to get back home.</p><p>The rest of the bike is just as impressive, especially because it can deliver 190 Nm of torque and travel at a rapid 36 mph. This is one of the most impressive bikes currently for sale in the e-bike segment, but the price tag is just as astonishing as the rest of the bike. The Optibike R22 Everest goes for $18,900, which is a princely sum, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you need a bike that can travel an extensive distance and you can afford it, it's one of the best bikes built in the USA.</p><h2 id=electric-bike-co-model-r>2. Electric Bike Co. Model R</h2><p>The Electric Bike Company builds all its e-bikes in Newport Beach, California. The e-bikes they sell can be fully customized for the customer, which means you'll get an e-bike that will have your unique flavor attached to it.</p><p>The great thing about these e-bikes is that the Electric Bike Company's <a href=#>Our Story section</a> states that they have a mission as to why they actually build e-bikes. They want people that wouldn't normally be able to enjoy a bike to enjoy all the benefits cycling can bring to every individual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It opens doors for the non-cyclist, the person who normally would not consider riding a bike because of hills, distance, age, fitness levels or even the simple inconvenience of arriving to work sweaty. An electric bike negates all of those stumbling blocks, motivating non-cyclists, to get on the saddle.</p><p>One of Electric Bike Company's most attractive models is the Model R e-bike. The great thing about this e-bike is that you can customize the bike's color scheme to a pretty extreme level. When they say their bikes are customizable, they mean it. The Electric Bike Company allows you to choose from tons of colors for the frame of the e-bike.</p><p>Three colors are free, and the rest are a $299 option. When you consider these bikes are built in California, $299 for a custom paint job is actually a decent deal. The suspension fork can also be customized in a variety of colors. Again, there are some free options; the rest are a $99 upgrade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Model R also offers four different options for the battery of the e-bike, even offering multiple battery setups that deliver up to 150 miles of range. I built my own personal Model R on Electric Bike Company's <a href=#>online configurator</a>, and the subtotal came in at $4,762. This makes the Model R quite expensive, but when you consider where the bike is made and the level of customization, it seems like a decent enough price.</p><h2 id=hpc-2022-trailblazer>3. HPC 2022 Trailblazer</h2><p>A quick look at Hi-Power Cycles' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">About Us section</a> will reveal the following information regarding this company's mission:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011 Hi-Power Cycles added employees and began to heavily invest in their own frames and proprietary battery systems. Throughout the next year HPC started to passionately build their own branded bikes from the ground up entirely in Los Angeles, CA. Founders Chris and Derek Hunt are very passionate about keeping these high performance bikes hand-made right here in the USA.</p><p>This company is clearly very proud that they build their bikes in the USA and are intent on continuing to do so. One of their most impressive e-bikes is the Trailblazer. The Trailblazer has one of the nicest designs you'll ever see on an e-bike; it looks super capable and mean. This electric bike has many configuration options, starting with the choice of three distinct power levels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can opt for the standard 750W option or choose between the more powerful 1200W and 1600W power levels. It's also possible to choose between 3 distinct battery options for the Trailblazer bike. The standard battery is a 52V, 10.5 Ah unit. The optional batteries are a 14Ah unit or the version with the most capacity, the 17.5 Ah unit. This e-bike is quite expensive from the get-go, starting at $5,995. But, there are quite a few options, and they'll quickly hike the already expensive price.</p><h2 id=more-us-based-e-bike-manufacturers-please>More US-Based E-Bike Manufacturers Please</h2><p>These e-bike companies all build amazing e-bikes, and they're all proud that they built them in the USA. Due to the huge rise in popularity of e-bikes, it will be interesting to see if more manufacturers follow suit and move production to the USA. Hopefully, new manufacturers will also begin to appear with innovative, brand-new offerings in the segment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirqKhdmq%2Bqt8SsZKaZlJp6qrqMrZ%2BeZaWornA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./which-gilmore-girls-character-are-you.html>&#171;&nbsp;Which Gilmore Girls Character Are You?
