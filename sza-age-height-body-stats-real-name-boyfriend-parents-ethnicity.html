She has an older half-sister, Tiffany Daniels. Like most children of devout Muslims, she attended conventional schools during the day and Muslim preschool at night.</p><p>Born on November 8, 1990, She is of African-American descent, although her two parents have different religious beliefs. Her mother is Christian, while her father is a Muslim. Her real name is Solàna Imani Rowe.</p><p>SZA is an exceptional student who excelled in the natural sciences while attending the famous Columbia High School. As a student, she was an excellent gymnast who was particularly interested in marine biology. As a teenager, she was ranked as one of the nation’s brightest stars in gymnastics. After leaving Columbia High School, she enrolled at Essex County College to study liberal arts.</p><p>As a young child, SZA’s musical leanings were influenced by the conservative values of her fathers, which meant she was shielded from the harsh and vulgar lyrics of mainstream pop music. This meant that she listened a lot to Ella Fitzgerald and music from her father’s record collection, which included a lot of Incognito, Jamiroquai, and Groove Theory.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>T.J. Dillashaw Wife (Rebecca Dillashaw), Height, Net Worth, Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>It’s no surprise that her music style is a genre-blurring fusion of different sounds delivered by her unique and rich vocals. Her journey into professional music began in 2011 when she met Top Dawg Entertainment, a successful record label that hosted established names like Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, and others.</p><p>The following year, on October 29, 2012, SZA itself released its first EP See.SZA.Run. Following positive reviews, She dropped their second EP called S in April 2013, which culminated in the release of a music video for the song “Ice Moon”. On 14 July 2013, she was formally signed to Top Dawg Entertainment.</p><p>She released her critically acclaimed debut album, Ctrl, in June 2017, with an impressive body of work including collaborations with Pharrell Williams, Frank Dukes, and Tyran Donaldson. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B/Hip-Hop charts. With Ctrl, She had set an example, and the heavyweights of the industry began to sit up and take notice of their undeniable talent.</p><p>The album also went platinum and received five nominations at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Urban Contemporary Album.</p><p>Following the success of Ctrl, she was featured on the hit single What Lovers Do by Maroon 5. The title reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was hert first Top 10 hit as a featured artist.</p><p>She was also involved in a remix of Lorde’s Homemade Dynamite together with Khalid and Post Malone. In early 2018, SZA and Lamar worked together on the title All the Stars, the soundtrack to the movie Black Panther. She also joined Cardi B on her single I Do.</p><p>SZA’s musical style has earned admiration from people like Kendrick Lamar, Chance The Rapper, and others who are blessed with the gift of poetry. Their sound is often so fluid that it transcends musical definition. Their sound can best be classified as a fusion of soulful R&B with layers of jazz and classical folklore.</p><p>Her sound is strongly influenced by Lauryn Hill, Ella Fitzgerald, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Macy Gray, and Björk.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Maite Perroni Bio, Her Childhood, Family Life, Acting Career and Other Facts</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Parents</strong></h2><p>The SZA’s father, Abdul Mubarak-Rowe, was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother, whose identity remains somewhat vague, was formerly an executive at AT&T.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>There is very little official information about SZA’s love life, but rumor has it that she is dating Scott Sasso, CEO of 10 Deep, a New York-based streetwear clothing line.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SZA Body Stats, Height</strong></h2><p>SZA is a pretty lady with an impressive physique, she stands at 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 62 kg.
