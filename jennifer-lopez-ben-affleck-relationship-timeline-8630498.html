Affleck’s roller coaster love story has spanned over two decades, with proposals, breakups, and marriages to other people in between.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the couple found their way back to each other in 2021, Lopez and Affleck were linked to other people. From 2004 to 2014, Lopez was married to singer Marc Anthony – with whom she shares twins Emme and Max – and later dated Casper Smart and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alex Rodriguez</a>. Meanwhile, Affleck was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and shares Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel with the Alias actress. He was then romantically tied to SNL’s Lindsey Shookus and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ana de Armas</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From their first meeting and engagement to their initial split, the early years of Bennifer’s whirlwind romance were plagued with intense tabloid attention, and they called it quits in 2004. Decades later the Hustlers actress and Justice League star reconnected, getting back together officially in 2021. After going public with a PDA-packed Instagram post, got engaged for the second time and tied the knot in July 2022.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s a look back at J.Lo and Affleck’s relationship timeline, from their infamous meeting on the set of Gigli to their second engagement, and everything they’ve said about each other in between.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Early 2002: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck meet on the set of Gigli</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the co-stars were introduced, it was sparks at first sight for Lopez. "I really felt like when I met Ben, 'Okay, this is it,’” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> in a 2016 interview. Lopez filed for divorce from her husband at the time, Cris Judd, in 2002, and she and Affleck began stepping out together shortly after.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You can’t pinpoint it,” Lopez told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access Hollywood</a> in a 2003 interview about when the couple first fell in love. “We became friends first. That is the honest to God truth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Gigli bombed at the box office, with critics citing a perceived lack of chemistry between the pair, their relationship only heated up in real life – and “Bennifer” quickly became one of the most talked-about couples of the moment.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>November 2002: Affleck proposes to Lopez with a 6-carat pink diamond ring</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Gone Girl star popped the question with a custom pink ring from Harry Winston just months later, and Lopez couldn’t stop gushing how “very, very beautiful” the moment was.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2002 interview with Diane Sawyer</a>, Lopez said the proposal was "traditional, but also [done] in a very spectacular way, as of course Ben would do it.” Piling the praise on her then-fiance, whom she called “brilliantly smart … loving, charming, affectionate,” the “On The Floor” singer also clapped back against critics who questioned the pair’s compatibility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We're probably more alike and from the same kind of background and, you know, same kind of upbringing and same kind of family and same kind of house,” she said of their similar roots.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>November 2002: The “Jenny From The Block” music video premieres</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Affleck and Lopez poked fun at the media attention surrounding their relationship with the PDA-packed “Jenny From the Block” music video. In it, the couple made out on yachts, a hotel balcony, and while pumping gas – all while paparazzi snapped secret photos of them.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2003: Affleck and Lopez start filming Jersey Girl together</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The movie, which featured Affleck as a New York publicist and Lopez as his wife who dies in childbirth, was also panned by critics when it was released.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 2003: Affleck and Lopez delay their wedding, citing tabloid attention</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date," the couple said in a statement that was released just days before their planned wedding date, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate decoy brides at three different locations, we realized that something was awry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They added, "We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, the couple briefly split, but then quickly rekindled their romance – and engagement – shortly after.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2004: Lopez and Affleck break up again</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of the actors’ publicists confirmed Bennifer’s engagement was off in separate statements on January 22, shortly before the couple was expected to attend the Golden Globes together. The announcement came just days after the actor was spotted solo at the Sundance Film Festival, during which he told reporters, “Everything’s going along fine. We’re good,” per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez later opened up about how hard it was to cope with the “painful” breakup in a November 2022 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once we called off that wedding 20 years ago, it was the biggest heartbreak of my life,” she said. “I honestly felt like I was going to die. It sent me on a spiral for the next 18 years where I just couldn't get it right.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2016: Lopez reflects that there was “genuine love” between her and Affleck</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Selena star later told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> in a 2016 interview that their split felt like an issue of timing, and that there was “genuine love” between the couple. “I think [a] different time, different thing, who knows what could’ve happened,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also slammed tabloids for creating “a lot of pressure” in their romance. “We didn’t try to have a public relationship,” she said. “We just happened to be together at the birth of the tabloids, and it was like ‘Oh my God.’”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2020: Affleck reveals he keeps in touch with his ex while showing support</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Suicide Squad star was all praise when talking about Lopez’s acting abilities in a 2020 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, even arguing that his ex should have gotten an Oscar nod for her role in Hustlers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She should have been nominated. She's the real thing," Affleck said in an unused clip from the interview, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times reporter Brooks Barnes</a>. "I keep in touch periodically with her and have a lot of respect for her. How awesome is it that she had her biggest hit movie at 50? That's f*cking baller."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>January 2021: Affleck reflects on the tabloid pressure of dating Lopez&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The next year, Affleck talked about his ex during another interview, this time looking back on the treatment she’d endured from critics and the media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People were so f*cking mean about her — sexist, racist,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter</a> during a podcast interview. “Ugly, vicious sh*t was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now you would literally be fired for saying those things.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Again, he didn’t hold back the praise, arguing, “I would say you have a better shot, coming from the Bronx, of ending up as like [Sonia] Sotomayor on the Supreme Court than you do of having Jennifer Lopez's career and being who she is at 50 years old today."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>April 5, 2021: Affleck calls his ex the “hardest-working person” in the business</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>In an April <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a> cover story featuring Lopez, the publication tapped the musician’s exes as well as stars like Michelle Obama, Lili Reinhart, Matthew McConaughey, and Affleck to talk about the multi-hyphenate. Affleck once again had nothing but good things to say about his former flame.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought I had a good work ethic, but I was completely humbled and blown away by what she was committed to doing day in and day out, the seriousness in which she took her work, the quiet and dedicated way she went about accomplishing her goals, and then how she would go back and redouble her efforts," he told the publication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, “She has great talent, but she has also worked very hard for her success, and I’m so happy for her that she seems, at long last, to be getting the credit she deserves.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Last Duel star also quipped about Lopez’s ageless appearance, adding, “Where are you keeping the fountain of youth? Why do you look the same as you did in 2003 and it kind of looks like I’m in my 40s...at best?"&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez returned the compliment, responding, "Ben is funny.

While sources told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> that they were just “friends” at the time, romantic speculation heated up when the couple was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>spotted taking a trip to Montana</a> together.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>July 24, 2021: Lopez and Affleck become Instagram official</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following months of hangouts and PDA-packed sightings, Bennifer confirmed that they were back together with a social media hard launch.

Their PDA-filled appearance at the Venice Film Festival showed the couple was going strong. Lopez, who wore a white mermaid-cut gown by Georges Hobeika that sparkled with Swarovoski crystal embellishments, was all smiles as she made out with her black tux-clad boyfriend on the red carpet.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 13, 2021: Bennifer stuns in matching Ralph Lauren ‘fits at the Met Gala</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lovebirds stopped to share a kiss through their black masks while walking the red carpet at their first Met Gala together.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 20, 2021: Affleck raves about how inspiring his girlfriend is</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After J.Lo was named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Adweek's 2021 Brand Visionary</a>, The Flash actor told the publication he’s “in awe of [Lopez’s] effect on the world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“At most, as an artist, I can make movies that move people,” he said. “Jennifer has inspired a massive group of people to feel they have a seat at the table in this country.

We know what’s real, what’s not real.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez also hinted that she saw the couple working out long term. "I don't think we would have got back together if we thought [a breakup] was where it was headed," she said. "We feel like what we found again is so much more important, and how we protect that and how we live our lives — what to share, what not to share — is the balance that we have now, the benefit of experience and the wisdom that we gained over the years."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_102-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>February 8, 2022: Lopez and Affleck attend the premiere of Marry Me</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Maid in Manhattan actress looked bridal at the premiere for her rom-com, in which she starred opposite Owen Wilson.
