after posting a nude photo of himself and his girlfriend, along with an incredibly crude caption that talked about his desire to 'bang her&nbsp;on every piece of furniture in his house'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jay Alvarrez, 23, who was born in Hawaii and is now based in Los Angeles, shared the image of himself and Italian model Valentina Fradegrada on Saturday, and within seconds found himself under heavy fire from online critics who branded him 'disgusting' and 'desperate for likes'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The image shows Valentina standing totally naked while covering her breasts with one hand and arm, and snapping the photo in the mirror with her other hand. Jay meanwhile is seen with one arm around her crotch while peering around her waist to smile at the camera.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-1779b12606dfe050 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/13/14013102-0-image-a-17_1558960560375.jpg height=794 width=634 alt="Shock: Male model Jay Alvarrez sparked outrage on Saturday when he posted this nude selfie taken with his girlfriend Valentina&nbsp;Fradegrada" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Shock: Male model Jay Alvarrez sparked outrage on Saturday when he posted this nude selfie taken with his girlfriend Valentina&nbsp;Fradegrada</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is not just the risque nature of the photo itself that has outraged his followers however, but also the incredibly sexual caption that was shared with the image - which was taken in Ibiza, where the two appear to be enjoying a vacation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I wish you were my big toe so I could bang you on every piece of furniture in my house,' he wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unsurprisingly - particularly given that Jay has over 6.3 million followers on the social media site - the image quickly began racking up comments, many of which slammed the model for 'degrading' his girlfriend and 'treating her like an object'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Sad how you brag this woman as an object. Sadder how she doesn't know her value,' one commenter wrote, while another said: 'This is honestly disgusting and I feel so sorry for this girl lol.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another offered advice to Jay, and urged him to think more carefully about the things he is showing to his followers - while addressing the fact that a number of his most dedicated fans had tried to defend the saucy snap.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Speaking as a women// as mother // of very young boys I can understand the urging that many of your followers are trying to speak to you,' she wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/12/14012580-0-image-a-11_1558958353928.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Prince Harry 'can't take his eyes off Archie' and he and...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/11/14010140-0-image-a-54_1558951884313.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Bearded woman who feared she'd never find love reveals she's...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <img id=i-8ddaac0d7b748945 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/13/14013106-0-image-m-33_1558961251849.jpg height=662 width=634 alt="'Degrading': Many people also took offense at the caption posted with the image, in which Jay referenced 'banging' his girlfriend on different furniture in his home" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'Degrading': Many people also took offense at the caption posted with the image, in which Jay referenced 'banging' his girlfriend on different furniture in his home</p><img id=i-f8aab105b5540dd5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/14/14013104-7075015-image-m-40_1558963298938.jpg height=587 width=634 alt="Risque: It is not the first naked photo that Jay has shared of Valentina on his account, having shared this saucy snap just days before the offending image was shared" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Risque: It is not the first naked photo that Jay has shared of Valentina on his account, having shared this saucy snap just days before the offending image was shared&nbsp;</p><img id=i-3d3f06f9fb4e7576 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/13/14013110-0-image-m-24_1558960617195.jpg height=457 width=306 alt="Putting it out there: Both Jay and Valentina regularly post mode risque shots of their bodies on Instagram, where they have a combined following of over eight million fans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-be3848f2800a45f2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/13/14013122-0-image-a-25_1558960623519.jpg height=457 width=306 alt="Putting it out there: Both Jay and Valentina regularly post mode risque shots of their bodies on Instagram, where they have a combined following of over eight million fans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Putting it out there: Both Jay and Valentina regularly post mode risque shots of their bodies on Instagram, where they have a combined following of over eight million fans</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Recognize yourself as an influencer and understand the responsibility that you have.
