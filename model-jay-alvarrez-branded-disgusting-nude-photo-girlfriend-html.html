after posting a nude photo of himself and his girlfriend, along with an incredibly crude caption that talked about his desire to 'bang her&nbsp;on every piece of furniture in his house'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jay Alvarrez, 23, who was born in Hawaii and is now based in Los Angeles, shared the image of himself and Italian model Valentina Fradegrada on Saturday, and within seconds found himself under heavy fire from online critics who branded him 'disgusting' and 'desperate for likes'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The image shows Valentina standing totally naked while covering her breasts with one hand and arm, and snapping the photo in the mirror with her other hand. Jay meanwhile is seen with one arm around her crotch while peering around her waist to smile at the camera.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-1779b12606dfe050 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/13/14013102-0-image-a-17_1558960560375.jpg height=794 width=634 alt="Shock: Male model Jay Alvarrez sparked outrage on Saturday when he posted this nude selfie taken with his girlfriend Valentina&nbsp;Fradegrada" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Shock: Male model Jay Alvarrez sparked outrage on Saturday when he posted this nude selfie taken with his girlfriend Valentina&nbsp;Fradegrada</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is not just the risque nature of the photo itself that has outraged his followers however, but also the incredibly sexual caption that was shared with the image - which was taken in Ibiza, where the two appear to be enjoying a vacation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I wish you were my big toe so I could bang you on every piece of furniture in my house,' he wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unsurprisingly - particularly given that Jay has over 6.3 million followers on the social media site - the image quickly began racking up comments, many of which slammed the model for 'degrading' his girlfriend and 'treating her like an object'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Sad how you brag this woman as an object.
