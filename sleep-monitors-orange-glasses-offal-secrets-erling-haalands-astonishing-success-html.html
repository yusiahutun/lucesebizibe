Following his spells at Red Bull Salzburg and then Dortmund, he now weighs around 90kg. Much has been made of the 22-year-old's diet, which can reach up to 6,000 calories a day. Norway team-mate Josh King says: 'I've never seen anyone eat as much as he does. He just eats like a bear.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is also a cultural reason for that. The small farming town of Bryne, where Haaland grew up, promotes a high-protein diet. Haaland sees serious benefits in eating mineral-rich offal of properly grazed cows and enjoys heart and liver.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Eating quality food that is as local as possible is the most important,' he said. 'People say meat is bad for you but which?

Haaland's diet is balanced with carbohydrates — including his dad's lasagne — and a love of fish.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He fancies himself as a dab hand in the kitchen, too, learning when he left home for Molde at 16.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Some players are scared of carbs after growing up in academies and needing to hit targets,' one source says. 'Let's cut out rice, pasta... but that's your fuel for running.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Haaland does not appear to have that problem, with a varied menu. 'You should be my favourite people here,' he told chefs at City's training ground on his first day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When visiting family back home, he will indulge in a kebab pizza or Chinese food. They are rarities though. Obviously, Haaland has dined at Italian restaurant San Carlo and Catalan eaterie Tast, in Manchester — rites of passage for any top-flight footballer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Haaland dropped out of Pep Guardiola's side against Copenhagen earlier this month, the first time he has not started since his £51million move.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Guardiola said Haaland did not feel right after the victory over Southampton and City — mindful of his troubling injury record at Dortmund — have tried to manage his workload.

Haaland is set to be given a fortnight's break during the World Cup, too, given Norway did not qualify. 'Once you start to get soft tissue injuries, you need to stay on top of them. They don't just go away,' Walsh says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Clearly there has been something going on behind the scenes. They are putting a system around him in terms of diet, monitoring training, travel, strength and prevention. They will have details of what made him flare up. It might be certain methods in training — maybe a lot of shooting drills or consecutive training days on the grass.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Walsh discusses a small programme he introduced for a Premier League player to eradicate persistent hamstring issues. He says: 'Sometimes it takes issues to make a player think, 'This is annoying me, what can I do?' If it then shows signs of improvement after interventions, they realise it isn't rocket science. They get engaged.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Most players are a similar height and weight — 70-80kg and 5ft 10in to 6ft 2in. Then you get outliers — like Haaland.
