Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Who is Gavon Ramsay?</h2><p class=align-left>Gavon came into the spotlight on April 6th, 2018, after murdering a 98 years old Margaret Douglas in Wadsworth, Ohio. He was 17 years old when he committed the crime. He was born on March 23rd, 2001. Gavon Ramsay's parents are Christine and Stephen Ramsay.</p><h2>What happened to Margaret Douglas?</h2><p class=align-left>On April 9th, 2018, <a href=#>police officers</a> at the Wadsworth Police Department received a call from the family of Margaret Douglas. The caller reported that the 98-year-old grandmother, who lived alone, had not been heard from. The officers went to her home to perform a wellness check but did not find her.</p><p class=align-left>The police began searching for Margaret Douglas. They were joined by her nephew, Howard Leasure and his wife, Cindy, in the evening. When Howard went to check his aunt’s closet, he made a horrifying discovery. Underneath a pile of clothing was Margaret Douglas' lifeless body.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61d1c079a0a64c2c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Lori Hayes story: How was Dale Lash arrested and where is he now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/850791058ea90092.jpg><p class=align-left>The way her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">clothing was dishevelled</a> and torn in some places suggested that she could have been raped. A trauma on her neck also suggested she might have been strangled. There were also bruises on her head and face.</p><h2>Police investigation of the murder</h2><p class=align-left>The Wadsworth police suspected a burglary because the old lady's wallet was missing. However, as they searched the property, they discovered the only clue, a plastic glove. It had been discarded at the back of his house.</p><p class=align-left>The police began interrogating the <a href=#>family</a> member. They then called in David, who looked after Margaret and occasionally came to help with house chores. He agreed to take a DNA test, which did not match that in the crime scene.</p><p class=align-left>When the autopsy report came, there was no indication that Margaret had been sexually assaulted. Nevertheless, the officers kept looking for the suspect. It would be an unlikely incident that would lead them to the murderer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c2213510c4c9b93.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tara Lynn Grant's tragic story: Where is her husband, Steven Grant now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The police began looking at more minor crimes in the area. They investigated reports that a construction site had been broken into. Whoever had done it left their phone behind, and they traced it to a man called Zachary.</p><p class=align-left>Zachary quickly revealed that his friend Gavon Ramsay was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved in the crime</a>. Moreover, he told the police that they had been involved in other crimes. He said all had been Ramsay's idea.</p><h2>The arrest of Gavon Ramsay</h2><p class=align-left>The police brought Gavon in for questioning. He came accompanied by his mother because she was a minor. He admitted several crimes, including breaking into <a href=#>cars</a>. However, when he was asked about Margaret Douglas's murder, he denied it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61d1c079a0a64c2c.jpg><p class=align-left>When the police looked at Ramsay's <a href=#>phone</a>, they were shocked to find the photos and videos of the old lady on the gadget. They had been taken from Margaret's house without her knowledge. The police took him into custody, and in the interview room, he began confession.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Donnah Winger murder case: What happened to convict Mark Winger?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ramsay admitted that he had snuck into Margaret Douglas' house. When he got inside, he had begun recording her while she slept. However, when she woke up, he forced her onto the ground and strangled her before realising what he was doing.</p><p class=align-left>Ramsay then spent hours taking more videos and photographs of her corpse, including several of a sexual nature. He would then move her into the closet and go back to his home before his parents woke up at 5 A.M. The police arrested him for murder.</p><p class=align-left>When the police searched his house, they found all the needed evidence. There was a glove matching the one retrieved at the crime scene. He also had a journal where he had written about serial killers.</p><h2>Prosecution and sentencing of Gavon Ramsay</h2><p class=align-left>The DNA test matched with that on the glove found in Douglas's compound. He was charged with murder and other lesser offences and stood trial as an adult. Gavon Ramsay's family explained to the court that he had mental health issues.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7218c017dc03a45d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Skylar Neese: The tragic story of the teen murdered by her friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His mother explained how she had sought help for him through counselling and medication.

Therefore, Prosecutor S. Forrest Thompson urged Judge Joyce Kimbler to sentence him to life without parole.</p><p class=align-left>The Wadsworth killer was sentenced to life without parole because he was unfit to re-enter society. He is currently serving his sentence at Grafton Correctional Institution in Lorain County.</p><h2>Gavon Ramsay's appeal</h2><p class=align-left>Challenges to a life sentence without parole handed to Gavon were rejected by the Ohio 9th District Court of Appeals. The court denied three assignments of error put forth on behalf of Ramsay. Two were regarding his age and ability to reform while in prison.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cdcdb09edb7f16c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Bernadette Protti: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, the Ohio Senate Bill 256 grants parole eligibility to individuals convicted of violent crimes, including murder and rape. However, the individual must have served 18 to 30 years in prison if they committed those crimes before turning 18. Therefore, Gavon could appeal soon.</p><p class=align-left>Patricia Leasure, Douglas's niece, said her <a href=#>family</a> has been through a roller-coaster ride since her aunt’s death. She added that if Ramsay is ever eligible for parole, she said the family would oppose his release.</p><h2>Is Gavon Ramsay related to Gordon Ramsay?</h2><p class=align-left>These two are not related despite sharing a surname. Gordon, a British chef, restaurateur, <a href=#>television personality</a>, and writer is the son of Helen Cosgrove and Gordon James Sr.</p><h2>Quick facts about Gavon Ramsay</h2><li>How old is Gavon Ramsay?
