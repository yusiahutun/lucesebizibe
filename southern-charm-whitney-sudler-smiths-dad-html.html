In the section titled “Becoming Patricia,” the matriarch detailed how she became the woman fans know and love today. And that story included how she met Whitney’s father — her first husband, Lon Smith.</p><p id=par-3_42>She shared that a friend introduced her to Lon when she was living in Washington D.C. and attending George Washington University. Five years her senior and the head of Dun & Bradstreet at the time, Patricia described Lon as “good-looking” and “mature.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_14>“When you’re Southern and in your twenties, marriage is a top priority,” Patricia wrote.</p><p id=par-5_50>The couple married in a small wedding ceremony with just their immediate families. Patricia and Lon then settled in Virginia, and she continued her studies in art history and archaeology. Meanwhile, Lon worked at Dun & Bradstreet during the day and attended graduate school at night to earn his MBA.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Whitney Sudler-Smith’s dad, Lon Smith?</h2><p id=par-6_43>After getting her BA and Master’s Degrees from GW, Patricia became an assistant professor of art appreciation and a survey of Western art at her alma mater. She became a mom on June 2, 1968, when she and Lon welcomed their son Whitney.</p><p id=par-7_24>Patricia wrote in her book that Lon was a great etiquette teacher for Whitney, and that’s how her son learned to become a gentleman.</p><p id=par-8_41>“Honestly, Lon was such a gentleman that Whitney learned by his example,” she described. “He saw his father open my car door, or stand when I entered the room, and eventually it became second nature for him to do the same.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_26>But even though her life seemed like it was straight out of a 1950s sitcom, Patricia says that she and Lon eventually found themselves “growing apart.”</p><p id=par-10_53>“Actually, we were so young when we married that maybe we were finally growing up,” Patricia wrote. “After fourteen lovely years of marriage, there was no acrimony between us—just a sense that we were moving in different directions. Our separation and divorce were completely civilized and our main concern was always our son.”</p><h2 id=h-the-southern-charm-star-says-she-couldn-t-have-picked-a-better-father-for-whitney>The ‘Southern Charm’ star says she ‘couldn’t have picked a better father for Whitney’</h2><p id=par-11_34>Both Patricia and Lon settled in Georgetown — where Whitney attended school — after their divorce. She says they established a “seamless co-parenting schedule,” and whenever they spoke they were “pleasant, respectful, and harmonious.”</p><p id=par-12_42>“There was nothing pernicious about our relationship at the time, and we’re still that way after all these years,” Patricia wrote. “I couldn’t have picked a better father for Whitney, who never had to feel divided about his feelings for his parents.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_41>Will fans ever see Whitney’s dad on Southern Charm? Probably not. According to Patricia, her first husband is “intensely private” and a “lovely man.” He’s retired and reportedly living in Florida, and has managed to stay out of the public eye.</p><p id=par-14_26>“My dad and my step mom are bemused by the show and all the hijinks,” Whitney told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bravo’s Daily Dish</a>, describing the pair as “intellectuals.” “</p><p id=par-15_9>They just don’t take it seriously; it’s pop culture.”</p><p id=par-16_10><a href=#>Southern Charm Season 8</a> premieres Thursday, June 23, on <a href=#>Bravo</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAsMHToZyrpl2YtaK%2BzGauoaGko7K6edKum6WdomLArrXToapmnJGZe6nAzKVm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./easter-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;70 Fun Facts About Easter You Must Know</a>
