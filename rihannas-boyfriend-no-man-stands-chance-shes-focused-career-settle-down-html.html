first boyfriend Negus Sealy, a Bajan local<br></p><p><span>But he accepts that like so many of other flings in recent years, there’s no chance of anything long-term.<br></span></p><p><span>Talking from his home in the Caribbean, Negus, 27, said: 'She would be the perfect girlfriend and of course I fancy her – what guy wouldn’t?<br></span></p><p><span>'She’s absolutely amazing and gorgeous and she has a very, very strong persona.<br></span></p><p><span>'I am so lucky to have spent so much time with her and will always consider her to be a closer personal friend.<br></span></p><p><span>'I value her so much because she has been pretty much been straight up and real with me from the beginning.<br></span></p><p><span>'But right now she doesn’t have time for anything serious with any guy.'<br></span></p><p><span>Speaking over a locally brewed Banks beer, Negus told how he first met Rihanna at a party when she was 15 and they instantly hit it off.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'We were introduced by a mutual friend. We shared the same sense of humour; she likes to laugh. I guess we pretty much took to each other’s character and it was just cool ever since then.'</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/03/article-2056906-0EA4EE6500000578-441_468x609.jpg height=609 width=468 alt="Throwing some moves: Negus was pictured romping with Rihanna at a carnival in Barbados this summer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Throwing some moves: Negus was pictured romping with Rihanna at a carnival in Barbados this summer</p><p><span>Negus said he immediately picked up there was something special about her.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'I figured it was like a deeply embedded ambition in her to be a star – that’s what my first impression was, that she was actually destined to be something great.<br></span></p><p><span>'She never told me personally that she wanted to be a star but I could pick it up from her posture, her singing and how seriously she took everything.'<br></span></p><p><span>The pair became inseparable and would hang out together on Barbados’s stunning white sandy beaches and go swimming and jet skiing together.<br></span></p><p><span>Negus recalled: 'We would just chill and have a good time. We go to the beach, party, just basic socialising. Then things would go from there.'<br></span></p><p><span>Rihanna – real name Robyn Fenty - left for America soon afterwards but the pair would keep in regular contact via phone, email and texts.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/03/article-2056906-0EA4EC7400000578-876_468x657.jpg height=657 width=468 alt="Opening up: Sealy broke his silence to speak about his intensely close relationship with the R&B beauty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Opening up: Sealy broke his silence to speak about his intensely close relationship with the R&B beauty</p><p><span>Negus told how their informal relationship means he's never actually had to take Rihanna on a formal date.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'It wasn’t necessary for me to ask her out on a date because we all (Rihanna and her local friends) hang out anyhow. We just get on well and go with it.'<br></span></p><p><span>The long-haired Barbadian modestly played down his nickname the Love God too.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'When I saw it I was like this is preposterous. It became a joke and my friends would joke on it and call me that after it was written but I don't lure the local ladies in Bridgetown.'<br></span></p><p><span>And he admitted Rihanna even ribbed him about it.<br></span></p><p><span>'At first she joked about it as well but we don’t really talk about the whole Love God thing anymore,' he said.<br></span></p><p><span>On Rihanna’s trip to Barbados back in August she stayed in the stunning 'One Sandy Lane' condo complex – an extension of the famous luxury resort.</span></p><p><span>Towering over the stunning white beach and neon blue Caribbean sea – it was entirely at Rihanna’s disposal for her trip.<br></span></p><p><span>Revealing only he and one other friend were invited to stay over by Rihanna, Negus said: 'We all loved it. The set up was really nice, with a pool bar. It was just a real nice place to chill with a perfect view of the coast.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/03/article-2056906-0EA4F68B00000578-262_468x520.jpg height=520 width=468 alt="Mind on the job: Negus says Rihanna is too focused on her singing career to settle down with a man" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Mind on the job: Negus says Rihanna is too focused on her singing career to settle down with a man<br></p><p><span>'It was just her close friends there, just a couple of us. It was a privilege but usually when she’s here we hang out and chill. She loves returning to Barbados to unwind and de-stress.'<br></span></p><p><span>Describing how it felt while he was dirty dancing with Rihanna at the annual Kadooment Day festival, Negus said: 'I don’t know how but photographers just have a habit of catching me at the worst times. Just my facial expression.<br></span></p><p><span>'People see a picture like this and think it’s just vulgarity or whatever but that’s how people in the Caribbean celebrate.<br></span></p><p><span>'Ladies from the Caribbean usually have a lot of rhythm and Rihanna’s no different. She’s a good dancer.'<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/03/article-2056906-0EA4F03B00000578-379_233x336.jpg height=336 width=233 alt="Former flame: Rihanna with ex Chris Brown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Former flame: Rihanna with ex Chris Brown</p><p><span>Negus - who is currently trying to start his own advertising and promotions business&nbsp; - also showed how protective he is of Rihanna and slammed Chris Brown for his horrific assault.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'It was quite horrible. It was terrible, I felt upset when that happened.'<br>Rihanna had even introduced her friend to Chris when he came to visit her in Barbados.<br>Negus said: 'He seemed cool when I first met him. But what he did was wrong.<br></span></p><p><span>'I didn’t appreciate it much obviously because she’s a friend of mine but I think she’s moved on.'<br></span></p><p><span>Negus perks up when speaking about Rihanna’s Coming Home concert at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown on August 5.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: 'It was even better than I anticipated, she was really good. It gave me goose bumps just to see how far she’s come. She always wanted to do it (perform in Barbados), the timing was right and she nailed it.<br></span></p><p><span>'I love her eccentric, sexy performances. She’s young, vibrant and edgy. She is just relishing every moment of it.<br></span></p><p><span>'She’s propelled herself to superstardom in a few odd years and done something that no one in Barbados has ever done, no in the Caribbean has ever done in that space of time.<br></span></p><p><span>'Quite frankly I’m pretty proud just to be friends with her and I will always be here for her in Barbados.'</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlpbWZufXd7saKfmqaelsBurs6ynauhlaOxbprOZqSapl2owaK6w6xknKCRo7CmeYysn56rXZu8pMHSnptmm5Gnsqa%2BjKycraycmnqlu9anZaGsnaE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./christie-murphy-wife-jamie-martin.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Christie Murphy's Wife Jamie Martin?</a>
