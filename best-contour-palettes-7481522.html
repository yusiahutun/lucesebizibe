The trouble is, it’s not quite so easy to master the contouring technique without overdoing it, and there are a truly shocking number of neutral browns, taupes, and chestnuts out there that make selecting the right one for your skin tone as stressful as a high stakes game of poker. Now for the good news: Any worthwhile contour palette contains a range of shades within the same tonal family, presenting you with a one-and-done, versatile collection, explains celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Vittorio Masecchia</a>. “Our faces range in color, texture, and shape from season to season, but honestly also from day to day," says Masecchia. "A palette will help keep makeup looking cohesive no matter what variations you experience with your skin."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With guidance from three celebrity makeup artists, we curated a list of 24 best-selling contour kits, and our editors, each with a variety of skin types and textures, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>individually tested</a> each one. We evaluated each contour palette for its color payoff, noting whether the shades were buildable or overly pigmented, how evenly the product smoothed across our skin, whether its texture and finish enhanced our natural features without looking overpowering, greasy, or drying, and lastly how easy or difficult it was to use the tools.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-hourglass-ambient-lighting-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k8-5Ex-rYHUKlD3ftpICb3VPinE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hourglass-ambient-lighting-palette-e1c286d221f24304b34abca3635b5c91.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pearlescent formula provides a gorgeous contour and an all-over radiance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Its shades are initially very pigmented.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You didn’t read the description wrong: This is technically a finishing powder palette, but many people, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Moss</a>, love it as a contouring palette. Similarly enthralled, we loved how the three soft powders layered like magic on top of each other, making it easy to achieve a natural look or something more intense. And, they didn’t look patchy on top of our foundation, dry patches, or breakouts no matter how many layers we applied. We evened out redness and patchy spots with the lighter colorways and manipulated the darker shades to create depth and dimensions. Additionally, Hourglass developed the formula with photoluminescent technology which subtly blurred and camouflaged our skin imperfections and gave us a radiant, sun-kissed finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Powder | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 3 | <strong>Colorways</strong>: 3 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Diamond powder, mica |&nbsp; <strong>Finish</strong>: Radiant</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-affordable-elf-cosmetics-cream-contour-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Affordable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

Even on our rough and bumpy complexions, the quartet of warm colors didn’t skip or drag the way drier formulas do (that’s what causes the dreaded “muddy” finish). We were super nervous that this rich and creamy formula would sink into the fine lines around our eyes and clog large pores, but, delightfully, it smoothed over these problem areas like fresh pavement. The dewy finish it leaves also means the creamy contours play well with other face makeup, so you can layer on your favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bronzers</a>, powders, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>blushes</a> to create a wide range of looks. While we had to mix the shades together to find our perfect match (even the darkest shade didn’t quite fit our skin tone) their serious blendability and natural finish earned our forgiveness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: Cream | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 4 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Mica, synthetic wax | <strong>Colorways</strong>: 3 | <strong>Finish</strong>: Dewy&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-tom-ford-shade--illuminate-highlighter--shader-duet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Shade & Illuminate Duet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tom Ford Shade and Illuminate Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-cO31V2WqUCAw0hCvK1wTUyuWc8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tom-ford-shade-and-illuminate-duo-59341de0439045988eb3f50a1555faaa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This palette streamlines your routine with just two shades, one to create dimension and the other to illuminate.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The<strong> </strong>coverage is subtle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Less is more with this palette, which features two shades — one contour and one highlight — to give your skin an ethereal ring-light effect. While the pearly white highlight left a subtle, dewy glow when we applied it across our cupid’s bow and under our eyebrows, its dark matte counterpart was a bit more pigmented. Still, we blended it out with minimal effort when we used a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup sponge</a> rather than a brush and gave the lightweight creamy formula a few seconds to dry between adding layers. Though the matte shade has a thicker texture, it felt airy and cloud-like on top of our oily skin and never sunk into pores or fine lines.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Notably, the formula was recently revamped to include hydrating botanical oils and a consistency that applies as a cream but diffuses into a satiny finish, making it very easy to buff and blend. And, each of the luminescent shades are made of brightening ingredients, including moringa and passion fruit oil, as well as ginger extract to neutralize hyperpigmentation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula: </strong>Cream | <strong>Number of Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Light-diffusing pearls, moringa and passionfruit oils, ginger extract | <strong>Colorways: </strong>4 |<strong> Finish: </strong>Natural</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fair-skin-smashbox-halo-sculpt--glow-face-palette-with-vitamin-e></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fair Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Smashbox Halo Sculpt + Glow Face Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Smashbox Contour Palette With Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zQukl5P6VqwXnAckZz6JPtkr0Eg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/smashbox-8fc9cebb31a04653bcf43659edb6fb57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Warm and cool-toned shades complement pale skin with a perfectly pigmented amount of color.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It takes around three layers to see a more intense color payoff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Streaking dark brown powders and rich creams across snow-white skin sounds like a recipe for clown makeup. However, between the buildable coverage, natural-looking colorways, and ultra-fine powder formula, we’re convinced Smashbox created this palette to quash the worries of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fair-skinned</a> friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the intimidating-looking, vibrant colors, the Coral Saturation palette impressed us with how its bright orange and chocolate brown shade warmly kissed pale skin with color rather than garishly contrasting against it. In fact, the matte powder is so fine we questioned whether our brush picked up any product at all but sure enough, we saw forgotten features start to take shape as we brushed the contour and sculpting shades along our jaw bones, sides of our nose, and cheekbones. Topped off with the shimmer highlight, this palette was made for romantic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>soft glam</a> looks, and since it’s so buildable, we’ll still keep it handy for when the occasion calls for something a bit bolder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula</strong>: Powder | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 4 | <strong>Colorways</strong>: 4 |<strong> Key Ingredients</strong>: Vitamin E, passion fruit oil | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-danessa-myricks-beauty-groundwork-defining-neutrals-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Danessa Myricks Beauty Groundwork: Defining Neutrals Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Danessa Myricks Beauty Groundwork: Defining Neutrals Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BNSjkZ5TlKa9Cw4vFr8YeOq_xu4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/danessa-myricks-beauty-groundwork-defining-neutrals---palette-for-eyes-brows-face--lips-c4b8f0d4d5e44493b56d361f58313db6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The finely milled powders and velvety creams smooth across textured skin without emphasizing fine lines, large pores, and blemishes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> All the shade options can be overwhelming to beginners.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Packed into this chocolate box-shaded pan are ten rich, pigmented powders and coordinating cream colors, opening the possibility to create any look we desire. Our brushes easily picked up the product and we hardly had to touch the brush to our skin to see a major color payoff. Each shade, whether we used matte powders to softly sculpt features or radiant creams to create more defined lines, blended like fine silk across dry patches, bumpy acne, and crow's feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that the large palette is perfect if you’re looking for a one-and-done product for browns, eyes, lips, and face, but it will take up a good chunk of space in your makeup kit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula</strong>: Powder, cream | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 10 | <strong>Colorways</strong>: 2 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Glycerin, squalane | <strong>Finish</strong>: Matte</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-professional-kvd-beauty-shade--light-powder-face-contour-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Professional</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KVD Beauty Shade + Light Powder Face Contour Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="KVD Beauty Shade + Light Powder Face Contour Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OdzFpKi2YlVfZkBydGwxRVpf07c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kvd-beauty-shade---light-powder-face-contour-palette-1ec5c33200314cdb8366d6bcd1be2e60.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This refillable palette offers six super blendable and pigmented shades, all with the same skin-brightening formula.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is some fallout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can give your selfie arm a rest — this KVD palette will capture and enhance all your best angles. Each of the six shades — three for highlighting and three for contouring — is paired on top of the coordinating partner so it was simple for us to know which two to use together. Their velvety soft texture applies similarly to a cream formula and sweeps daringly across our skin, delivering a blendable and smooth wash of color. The lightweight texture sat evenly across our textured skin and never made the appearance of our large pores, forehead wrinkles, or crow’s feet more noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the matte finish gave us pause — we feared it would emphasize our rough patches – the formula’s hydrating blend of wild rose extract, safflower seed oil, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin E</a> prevented any hint of caked or cracked-looking makeup. There’s something to gain from each shade, but if you reach the bottom on one color before the others, it’s easy to refill the magnetic pots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Powder | <strong>Number of Shades:</strong> 6 | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Wild rose extract, safflower seed oil, vitamin E | <strong>Colorways:</strong> 1 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-glow-charlotte-tilbury-filmstar-bronze--glow-contour-duo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Glow</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Bronze & Glow Contour Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze &amp;amp; Glow Contour Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/u3x0PfPaxn2MDkJWixsRrv4NUzU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-filmstar-bronze--glow-contour-duo-6fe869ae8acd49c4927c6b9c44f1376a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These beautiful shades are impossibly easy to buff into skin, offering a glowy, lit-from-within warmth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the best option for full glamour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This duo ranks as one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best Charlotte Tilbury products</a> — word on the street is that even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Victoria Beckham</a> wears it.

However, if a full glam look is what you’re after, it may be best to skip this one, as the coverage, while buildable, is on the lighter side. On the flip side, because it does offer a softer look, it’s a great option for beginners who are perfecting their technique.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Powder | <strong>Number of Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Mica, rice starch | <strong>Colorways: </strong>1 |&nbsp; <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-contour-highlight-palette-natasha-denona-tan-bronze--glow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Contour Highlight Palette</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natasha Denona Tan Bronze & Glow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Natasha Denona Tan Bronze &amp;amp; Glow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CNqcTqLUTAKJ6pjupxSnWGCU150=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/natashadenona-c58ea605aa024c1085e87b3fc8d3025f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Natasha Denona</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The trio of shimmer shades and one contour powder offers a bronzed, baked glow in a few easy sweeps.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in one colorway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re traveling somewhere warm, or just want to look like you did, this palette can fake a bronze better than your favorite self-tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tan blush-bronzer hybrid gave our cheekbones a warm, flushed finish, and when we paired it with the powder highlight and shimmering cream blushes, we swear our skin could light up even the darkest room.

Out of the five colorways, we gravitated most toward the concealer cream shade because it brightened our under eyes and didn’t leave behind a chalky residue or highlight the fine lines around this area.

Best of all, this fine powder avoids a muddy or dry finish, no matter how many layers we&nbsp; apply, and provides our oily skin with a smoothing matte finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a brand known for its over-the-top electric blue liners and luminous glitter eyeshadows, we expected the highlight shades to have a bit more va-va-voom. Yet, they still provided a subtle radiance thanks to MAC’s use of soft-focus filter technology, which reflects light to provide a slight blurring effect similar to your favorite translucent powder, but better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In typical MAC fashion, the palette is travel-friendly and sturdy, with a surprisingly large mirror.

Within this sturdy, portable, and robust palette are hues intended for sculpting, highlighting, bronzing, and blushing. After some trial and error, we discovered the 12 shades showed up more prominently when we applied them with our fingers rather than a sponge or brush, which soaked up much of the creamy product. For the most part, they mixed well with our foundation and layered across textured skin seamlessly, save for the concealer shade where we noticed a little creasing around our under-eye folds. Despite its radiant finish, the formula left zero oily residue behind and instead imparted a healthier glow rather than a greasy sheen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula:</strong> Cream | <strong>Number of Shades: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sunflower seed wax, evodia rutaecarpa extract | <strong>Colorways: </strong>2 | <strong>Finish: </strong>Radiant<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-buildable-fenty-beauty-match-stix-duo-contour-highlight-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Buildable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Match Stix Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Fenty Beauty Match Stix Duo Contour Highlight Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IiN7auUSxUrt8pfDTxMmT3SPyJY=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-match-stix-duo-contour-highlight-set-bc2d64c683954f20ada16cbc4bf39dfa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The creamy and pigmented shades layered seamlessly on top of each other and with our other makeup.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Having a blush shade would really make this a winner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Matched with our foundation, this cream contour and highlight duo was an unstoppable force against persistent breakouts and dry spots as it sneakily concealed them with a smoothing layer of product. With worries of flaking and cakiness off our minds,&nbsp; we easily manipulated the texture across different areas of our face and, since it didn’t dry too quickly, seamlessly blended it out into a natural, skin-like finish. On top of being super buildable, the rich, pigmented shade contrasted beautifully against our deeper skin tone, with zero chalky or orange residue left behind. And, for once, the highlighter noticeably popped off with a dewy, shimmery radiance rather than applying sheer like other options we’ve tried.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The easy-to-grip, chubby stick-style applicator makes this an especially approachable product for beginners – simply apply it directly to the area you want to enhance and buff out with your fingers.

We really enjoyed using the kit alongside our liquid foundation — not only adds dimension, but also because the powder formula set creamier products in place. The shades are on the lighter side, which is great for everyday use, and with some patience and practice, we eventually built them to a more striking look. Alongside the two matte contour shades are three highlight colors, which are deceptively shimmery in the pan, but in reality, they provide a subtle radiance that’s ideal for oily skin types who want to add glow without emphasizing their existing shine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Formula</strong>: Powder | <strong>Number of Shades</strong>: 6 | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Silica, vitamin E | <strong>Colorways</strong>: 1 | <strong>Finish</strong>: Matte, shimmer</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Formula: </strong>Your skin type, desired look, and experience level play a role in determining which formula, either cream or powder, is best for you.&nbsp;According to Vittorio, creams offer a hydrating, brightening, and dewy finish ideal for dry skin types, while powder tends to be more matte. Those with oil-prone complexions will benefit from using a palette with both cream and powder, says celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>J. Brandon Correa</a>, Tapping on a cream “allows for a very natural, skin-like finish,” he explains, and finishing the look with a little setting powder will lock your makeup in for all-day wear. For a more dramatic or dewy look, Correa suggests applying a creamy product on top of your foundation.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Shade: </strong>Unlike choosing a foundation or concealer, celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Kenneth Soh</a> says that because contour palettes are trying to cover as many skin tones as possible, they usually only offer a couple of shades. “However, you can also mix colors to customize a shade that’s perfect for you,” he adds. To find a cool tone optimal for your contour, Correa recommends picking hues that are at least two to three shades deeper than your complexion. Additionally, Soh suggests looking at your skin in a “well-lit, balanced environment” and choosing the shade that matches the color of the natural shadows on your face.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Application Method: </strong>While some formulas easily blend into skin using just your fingers, Soh says that to get the best results, you should be using a brush specifically designed for contouring. Try ditching a big fluffy one for one that has more densely packed bristles or an angled top. “You’re trying to carve out contours,” he explains.“Contouring requires a smaller brush to apply accurately and deliberately to hollow out an area.”<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I choose a contour palette for beginners?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where individual compacts only give you a single result (and hog space in your cosmetics bag), a huge advantage to contour palettes is their collection of hues to streamline the contouring process.“Most palettes should have multiple light and shimmer shades for highlighting and deeper tones for bronzing and contouring,” says Correa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But you don’t necessarily need an extensive palette to achieve your makeup goals — smaller palettes, with a contour and highlight shade, still give you what you need to achieve to sculpt and highlight your features.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you contour before or after foundation?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unless you’re practicing a more advanced technique such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>underpainting</a>, you typically apply contour products on top of foundation and skin tints. Correa recommends starting with matte highlighters first to avoid over-contouring or bronzing. “When you start with the deep shades, it might look ok until you apply a lighter shade right next to it, then it can be too bold.” Next, use the light matte shades on the high planes of your face, including your cheekbones, nose bridge, above arches of brows, and chin. Buff the deeper shades down the sides of the nose, as well as right below your cheekbones in a diagonal, from your ear toward the side of your nose, and along the jawline.
